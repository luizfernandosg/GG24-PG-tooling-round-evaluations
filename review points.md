- **Feedback on evaluation aspects**
    
    - **Interoperability (25 pts)** - HIGHEST PRIORITY
        - Are 2+ public goods primitives being integrated?
        - Is there a concrete execution plan with credible technical approach?
        - Evidence of upstream contributions (schemas, PRs, standards work)?
        - Does it enhance composability across the ecosystem?
    
    - **UX Impact (20 pts)**
        - Is the UX problem clearly defined (onboarding, gas, safety, privacy, dev-ex)?
        - Is there evidence of problem severity?
        - Is there a test/validation plan for UX improvements?
        - Will this meaningfully improve end-user experience?
    
    - **Product Maturity & Feasibility (15 pts)**
        - What's the current maturity stage (prototype, beta, production)?
        - Is the scope realistic for 4-6 weeks until Dec 9th?
        - Are risks identified with mitigation strategies?
        - Does the team have capacity to deliver?
    
    - **Collaboration (10 pts)**
        - Are integration partners specifically named?
        - Evidence of partnerships (MOUs, GitHub issues, letters of support)?
        - Shared roadmap or co-development plans?
        - Creates new cross-project connections?
    
    - **Team Track Record (10 pts)**
        - What has the team shipped previously?
        - Public repositories showing their work?
        - Audits, security reviews, or proof-of-ship?
        - Team members identifiable with credible backgrounds?
    
    - **Measurement Plan (10 pts)**
        - Specific metrics defined (onchain/offchain)?
        - Karma GAP integration plan?
        - EAS schemas or Hypercerts usage?
        - CIDS framework alignment (Interoperability, Collaboration, UI/UX, Product Growth)?
        - Impact reporting frequency and detail?
    
    - **Budget & Timeline (10 pts)**
        - Is funding request reasonable for scope?
        - Milestones clearly defined with acceptance criteria?
        - Timeline aligned with Dec 9th deadline?
        - Fallback plans if issues arise?
        - Clear about licenses and dependencies?

## Red Flags to Watch
- ❌ Scope too ambitious for timeframe
- ❌ No specific primitives named
- ❌ Vague milestones
- ❌ No measurement plan
- ❌ No visible track record
- ❌ Budget unjustified

## Green Flags to Look For
- ✅ 2+ primitive integrations
- ✅ Named partners with evidence
