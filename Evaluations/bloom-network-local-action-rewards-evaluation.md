## Key Aspects

### Integration/Development in Question
Design and pilot a Local Action Rewards (LAR) program that incentivizes community‑level impact activities (cleanup, mutual aid, climate resilience, etc.) and connects them to Ethereum primitives for credibility, coordination, and rewards. Work includes an MVP rewards framework, partner pilots with local nodes/communities, and developer assets (APIs/flows) to standardize impact issuance and verification.

### Funding Amount
$12,000 requested ($4,000 Education & Content Creation, $6,500 Onboarding Campaign & Training, $1,500 Project Management & Coordination)

### General Impression
Clear fit for public‑goods adoption at the local level. Strong narrative on bridging offline actions to onchain recognition and funding. Proposal lists concrete deliverables and pilots, but interop specifics (2+ primitives and upstream work), budget totals, and milestone acceptance criteria need to be nailed down for Dec 9.

### Alignment with Round
- Interoperability: Intends to use recognized primitives for attestations/impact; specify exactly which and the artifacts to ship.
- Collaboration: Multi‑stakeholder (local nodes, NGOs, municipalities, partners); provide named partners and evidence.
- UI/UX: Community onboarding and rewards flows; needs explicit UX problem framing and validation.
- Product Maturity: MVP + pilots by Dec 9 looks feasible with focused scope.

## Proposal Feedback

### What I Like About the Proposal
- Tackles a key adoption gap: connecting real‑world community actions to onchain recognition/funding
- Pilot‑driven approach with developer assets to generalize beyond a single city/community
- Potential to align with existing impact standards (EAS schemas, Hypercerts) to enhance credibility

### What Can Be Improved or Made More Clear
- Commit to at least two primitives (e.g., EAS + Hypercerts or EAS + OpenGrants/Karma GAP) with concrete artifacts and upstream PRs
- Provide itemized budget with totals and acceptance criteria per milestone
- Name launch partners (cities/NGOs/community nodes) with letters/issues/MOUs; add a simple risk register

### Questions
- Which two+ primitives will be integrated by Dec 9 and what artifacts will ship (schemas, adapters, example issuers, upstream PRs)?
- What is the total funding requested and per‑category breakdown? What are acceptance criteria for each milestone?
- Who are the confirmed pilot partners and what evidence can you share of commitments and timelines?

## Rubric-Based Analysis

## 🔹 **Interoperability**

### **Interoperability Score: 15/25**

### **Rationale:**

The proposal shows a Karma GAP profile present, and EAS/Hypercerts/OpenGrants are likely integrations though not explicit in the source material. The execution credibility is good with pilots and developer flows providing a solid path, though the proposal should specify adapters and upstream engagement more clearly.

Upstream contribution evidence is not shown - the proposal should include EAS schema PRs and Hypercerts example templates. The strength of the interoperability approach shows strong potential with clear artifacts, but needs more specificity on which primitives will be integrated and what upstream contributions will be made. Overall assessment is moderate, conditional on concrete integration commitments.

---

## 🔹 **UX Impact**

### **UX Impact Score: 15/20**

### **Rationale:**

The UX problem is clearly defined: there is friction for communities to document and verify impact and access rewards/funding. The narrative around the problem is strong, though baseline data would strengthen the case - participation rates and current workflows should be provided to quantify severity and evidence.

A test/validation plan should include pilot cohorts with before/after metrics and surveys, with success thresholds defined. The impact potential is high if issuance and verification become easy and credible, addressing a real gap in connecting offline community actions to onchain recognition. Overall assessment is moderate to strong, conditional on a more detailed validation plan.

---

## 🔹 **Product Maturity & Feasibility**

### **Product Maturity & Feasibility Score: 8/15**

### **Rationale:**

The current maturity stage shows a network and programs exist, with the LAR MVP being new. The scope appears realistic for the Dec 9th deadline - yes, for MVP issuance plus 1-2 pilots and reporting. Risks should be identified and mitigated more explicitly, including partner bandwidth, data quality, and device access concerns with corresponding mitigations.

Technical feasibility is reasonable with focused deliverables. The proposal demonstrates awareness of what's achievable within the timeline. Overall assessment is moderate.

---

## 🔹 **Collaboration**

### **Collaboration Score: 6/10**

### **Rationale:**

Several partners are referenced including local nodes and partners, though the names are not fully legible in the source material. Evidence of partnerships such as MOUs, issues, or letters is not linked and should be added. Shared roadmap elements are not shown - the proposal should include a simple partner milestone calendar to demonstrate coordination.

Despite these gaps, the cross-project potential is high for replication across cities. The proposal would benefit significantly from providing concrete evidence of partnerships and shared planning. Overall assessment is moderate, pending evidence of partnerships.

---

## 🔹 **Team Track Record**

### **Team Track Record Score: 6/10**

### **Rationale:**

The team background shows a network with prior local activation programs, though repos and program reports should be added. Previous shipped projects should include links to past pilots and code. Repository activity and quality information should be provided through GitHub links and quality signals.

Credibility indicators such as letters or references from partners would be helpful. While the network has experience, the proposal would benefit from more concrete evidence of past work and deliverables. Overall assessment is moderate, conditional on links and evidence being provided.

---

## 🔹 **Measurement Plan**

### **Measurement Plan Score: 6/10**

### **Rationale:**

Recommended KPIs include participants, actions verified, attestations/hypercerts issued, repeat participation, and partner adoption. The Karma GAP integration plan should provide a GAP link and weekly cadence aligned to CIDS. CIDS framework alignment fits Collaboration, UI/UX, and Product Growth categories, with Interoperability if EAS/Hypercerts are used.

Reporting frequency and detail should commit to weekly updates and a final report by Dec 9. While the foundation exists, the measurement plan needs more specificity and commitment. Overall assessment is moderate.

---

## 🔹 **Budget & Timeline**

### **Budget & Timeline Score: 6/10**

### **Rationale:**

The budget requires confirmed totals and rationale - the small scenario appears reasonable but needs explicit confirmation. Milestone clarity and achievability should define 3-4 milestones with acceptance criteria, such as issuance MVP, partner pilot live, metrics collected, and reporting. The timeline to Dec 9th appears feasible with tight scoping.

Acceptance criteria need to be specified explicitly. Risk mitigation and fallback planning should include alternative pilots and simplified flows if partner delays occur. While the structure is reasonable, clarity on totals and acceptance criteria would strengthen this section. Overall assessment is moderate.

**Conditions/Suggestions:**
- Commit to EAS + Hypercerts (or GAP/OpenGrants) with upstream PRs and example issuers
- Run at least one pilot by Dec 9 with defined KPIs and weekly GAP updates mapped to CIDS
- Publish simple developer docs/templates so other cities can replicate

- [x] UI/UX
- [x] Product Growth
- [x] Interoperability (conditional on integrations)

**Notes:** Treat primarily as Collaboration + Product Growth with strong Interoperability potential once primitives are specified and upstreamed.
