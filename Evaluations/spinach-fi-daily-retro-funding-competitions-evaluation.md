**Date:** 2025-10-22
**Evaluator:** Luiz Ferdinand
**Proposal Link:** [To be added]

---

## Key Aspects

### Integration/Development in Question
Multichain Spinach round development: (1) Develop and launch first multichain round showcasing retro funding across ecosystems; (2) Build multichain competition page with Gardens projects and cross-chain activity; (3) Run Gardens Pool Spinach competition distributing $3,000; (4) Integrate with Prosperity Pass for Celo rewards; (5) Create Hypercerts for participating projects.

### Funding Amount
$10,000 requested ($7,000 building/deploying, $3,000 builder incentives distributed to projects)

### General Impression
Proven track record with $25,000+ distributed to 15+ projects. Clear focus on multichain expansion and Gardens integration. However, concerns about multichain deployment scope - tracking file notes "I don't think multichain deployments should be funded in this pool" and proposal lacks details on which chains and implementation approach.

### Alignment with Round
- **Interoperability:** Moderate - integrates Gardens, Hypercerts, Prosperity Pass, Dune Analytics, but focus is on multichain deployment
- **Collaboration:** Good - Glo Dollar, Good Dollar, Regen, mentions Gardens, CeloPG
- **UI/UX:** Good - addresses builder funding UX through retroactive funding
- **Product Maturity:** Good - has proven track record, realistic scope

## Proposal Feedback

### What I Like About the Proposal
- Proven track record: $25,000+ distributed to 15+ projects
- Clear focus on Gardens integration
- Addresses real need: builder funding through retroactive competitions
- Good integration plan with Hypercerts and Prosperity Pass

### What Can Be Improved or Made More Clear
- Explicit multichain implementation details: which chains, what deployment work, current chain status
- Multichain deployment concerns: tracking file notes this shouldn't be funded in this pool
- More specific measurement plan: KPIs for adoption, distributions, reporting cadence
- Risk mitigation strategies for multichain complexity

### Questions
- Can you clarify multichain implementation: which chains, what deployment work, where is it currently deployed?
- Given tracking file concern about multichain deployments - can you refocus on interoperability integrations instead?
- What are the expected metrics (projects funded, distributions, TVL) and how will progress be tracked?
- What is the reporting cadence to Karma GAP and how will metrics be aligned to CIDS framework?

## Rubric-Based Analysis

### Interoperability (25 points)
**Focus:** Concrete plan + credible execution path to adopt at least 2 primitives; evidence of upstream contributions (schemas, PRs).

**Analysis:**
- Primitives being integrated: Gardens (explicit), Hypercerts (explicit), Prosperity Pass (explicit), Dune Analytics, mentions Regenerative.fi, Ubeswap. Meets 2+ requirement with Gardens + Hypercerts + Prosperity Pass.
- Execution credibility: High - has proven track record, clear integration approach, existing infrastructure.
- Upstream contribution evidence: Not explicitly committed - should specify contributions to Gardens, Hypercerts, or other primitives.
- Strength of interoperability approach: Strong - integrates multiple primitives, but multichain deployment focus may not align with round goals.

**Assessment:** Moderate → Strong (with focus clarification)

---

### UX Impact (20 points)
**Focus:** Clear definition of the UX problem (onboarding, account abstraction, safety, gas, dev-ex, privacy, etc.), severity evidence, and test plan.

**Analysis:**
- UX problem clearly defined: Builder funding is hard, especially for public goods. Liquidity incentives misaligned (mercenary users vs builders). Retroactive funding rewards verifiable impact.
- Severity and evidence: Strong narrative - builders struggle with funding, current incentives favor extractors. Proven track record demonstrates impact.
- Test/validation plan: Mentions Gardens competition and past distributions but doesn't specify success metrics or validation approach.
- Impact potential: High - addresses builder funding challenge, proven impact with $25k+ distributed.

**Assessment:** Strong

---

### Product Maturity & Feasibility (15 points)
**Focus:** TRL-style stage mapping with realistic scope for 4-6 weeks; risk register & mitigations.

**Analysis:**
- Current maturity stage: Production - has live platform (spinach.fi), proven track record, deployed competitions.
- Scope realistic for Dec 9th deadline: Yes - Gardens competition wrap-up by Dec 9 mentioned, realistic scope.
- Risks identified and mitigated: Not explicitly addressed - should add risk register (multichain complexity, integration delays, adoption challenges).
- Technical feasibility: High - existing infrastructure, proven execution, realistic scope.

**Assessment:** Strong (with risk register)

---

### Collaboration (10 points)
**Focus:** Named integration partners; MOUs/issues opened; co-maintenance or shared roadmaps.

**Analysis:**
- Named partners/collaborators: Good - Glo Dollar, Good Dollar, Regen, mentions Gardens, CeloPG, past work with CeloPG.
- Evidence of partnerships (MOUs, issues, etc.): Mentions past work but doesn't provide evidence of Gardens collaboration commitment or MOUs.
- Shared roadmap elements: Mentions Gardens competition wrap-up by Dec 9 but doesn't show joint milestone calendar.
- Cross-project potential: High - retro funding model benefits many builders and projects.

**Assessment:** Moderate (pending evidence)

---

### Team Track Record (10 points)
**Focus:** Repos, releases, audits, shipped infra; Proof-of-Ship track record.

**Analysis:**
- Team background and experience: Strong - Dev Lead Jen Goetz (developer dao/nightsweekends, Prev: ZKsync), UX Designer Marge (Prev: head of design at Pinata), Partnerships Lana Dingwall (Glo Dollar, prev: GreenPill Core Steward, Impact Reef, CharmVerse grants, Octant Governance Design).
- Previous shipped projects: Has live platform (spinach.fi), $25,000+ distributed, 15+ projects funded, GitHub repo provided.
- Repository activity and quality: GitHub org provided (github.com/SpinachFi), should verify current activity and quality signals.
- Credibility indicators: Excellent - proven track record, large distributions, strong team credentials, ecosystem connections.

**Assessment:** Strong

---

### Measurement Plan (10 points)
**Focus:** Which onchain/offchain metrics will be emitted; EAS schemas; Hypercert minting cadence; reporting via OpenGrants/Karma GAP.

**Analysis:**
- Impact metrics defined: Mentions verifying results on-chain and spinach.fi/history but doesn't specify KPIs (distributions made, projects funded, TVL tracked).
- Karma GAP integration plan: Karma GAP profile linked (https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/spinach---liquid-retro-funding) but doesn't specify reporting cadence or CIDS framework mapping.
- CIDS framework alignment: Likely fits Interoperability, Collaboration, and Product Growth categories. Should explicitly map to CIDS.
- Reporting frequency and detail: Not specified - should define weekly updates and final impact report by Dec 9.

**Assessment:** Moderate

---

### Budget & Timeline (10 points)
**Focus:** Value for money; milestone clarity; licenses; acceptance criteria; fallback plan.

**Analysis:**
- Budget reasonableness: $10,000 seems reasonable ($7,000 building, $3,000 incentives). Good breakdown.
- Milestone clarity and achievability: Clear deliverables (multichain round, Gardens competition, integrations) with verification methods (spinach.fi, GitHub, history page).
- Timeline to Dec 9th: Explicitly mentions "Gardens round will wrap up by December 9th" - good alignment.
- Acceptance criteria defined: Good - verification via spinach.fi, history page, GitHub. Mentions all milestones verifiable.
- Risk mitigation/fallback: Not addressed - should add risk register and mitigation strategies.

1. Proven track record: $25,000+ distributed to 15+ projects
2. Clear Gardens integration with wrap-up by Dec 9
3. Strong team with ecosystem connections

### Key Concerns / Red Flags
1. Multichain deployment concerns: tracking file notes this shouldn't be funded in this pool
2. Multichain implementation details missing: which chains, what work, current status
3. Measurement plan needs more specificity

### Critical Questions for Builder
1. Can you clarify multichain implementation: which chains, what deployment work, where is it currently deployed?
2. Given tracking file concern - can you refocus on interoperability integrations (Gardens, Hypercerts, Prosperity Pass) rather than multichain deployment?
3. What are the expected metrics and how will progress be tracked via Karma GAP?

## Final Recommendation

**Conviction Level:** Medium (conditional)

**Rationale:** Proven track record with strong team and ecosystem connections. Good Gardens integration. However, multichain deployment focus may not align with round goals per tracking file concerns. Recommend funding contingent on clarifying multichain scope (or refocusing on interoperability), explicit upstream contribution plan, and specific measurement plan.

**Conditions/Suggestions:**
- Clarify multichain implementation scope: which chains, what deployment work, or consider refocusing on interoperability integrations instead
- Specify upstream contribution plan: Gardens integration contributions, Hypercerts improvements, Prosperity Pass integration work
- Define measurement plan: KPIs (distributions made, projects funded, TVL tracked), weekly Karma GAP updates, CIDS framework mapping, final impact report by Dec 9
- Add risk register with mitigation strategies
