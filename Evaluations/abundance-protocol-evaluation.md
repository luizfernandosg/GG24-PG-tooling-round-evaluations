## Key Aspects

### Integration/Development in Question
Funding and incentive infrastructure to surface and reward impactful public‑goods work. Planned integrations include onchain attestations (EAS), Hypercerts, and Safe + Zodiac modules; Superfluid integration is mentioned as potential. Deliverables include onchain user roles/permissions for Impact 2.0, validation workflows, SDK + quickstart, and publishing to Safe App Store.

### Funding Amount
Scenario shows an amount requested of $5,000 with a breakdown (research/design, engineering, PM). Additional figures for in‑kind or expanded scope appear but totals are not fully legible. Please confirm final total request and per‑category allocations.

### General Impression
Well‑aligned proposal targeting a real gap: making it easier to fund and validate high‑impact contributions across public‑goods ecosystems. Clear intent to ship usable modules/SDK and integrate with widely used primitives (EAS, Hypercerts, Safe/Zodiac). Strong potential if integrations and examples land; budget totals and acceptance criteria need clarification.

### Alignment with Round
- Interoperability: Strong intent with multiple primitives; needs concrete scoped integrations and upstream contributions.
- Collaboration: Mentions DAO pilots and ecosystem partners; provide named pilots and evidence.
- UI/UX: Quickstart site + SDK can improve builder onboarding and recognition workflows.
- Product Maturity: Appears feasible for Dec 9 if scope is focused.

## Proposal Feedback

### What I Like About the Proposal
- Targets funding/recognition flows that many public‑goods teams need
- Integrates recognized primitives (EAS, Hypercerts, Safe/Zodiac) with SDK and app examples
- Clear GTM idea: 2 pilot DAOs, quickstart, Safe App Store listing

### What Can Be Improved or Made More Clear
- Confirm two+ integrations with concrete artifacts and upstream PRs (e.g., EAS schemas, Hypercert adapters)
- Provide an itemized budget with totals and acceptance criteria per milestone
- Name pilot DAOs/partners and share evidence (issues/MOUs/letters)

### Questions
- Which two+ primitives will be fully integrated by Dec 9 and what exactly ships for each (schemas, contracts, SDK adapters, example app, upstream PRs)?
- What is the final total funding request and the per‑category breakdown? What are acceptance criteria per milestone?
- Which DAOs will pilot Impact 2.0 roles/validation flows? What commitments/evidence can you share?

## Rubric-Based Analysis

## 🔹 **Interoperability**

### **Interoperability Score: 18/25**

### **Rationale:**

The proposal demonstrates strong intent for interoperability with multiple primitives including EAS, Hypercerts, Safe + Zodiac (explicitly mentioned), and Superfluid as a potential integration. The execution credibility is reasonable, though the proposal needs a task list per primitive and links to upstream engagement to strengthen this aspect.

Upstream contribution evidence is not shown in the proposal. The team should propose EAS schema PRs and Hypercert examples to demonstrate commitment to contributing back to the ecosystem. The strength of the interoperability approach shows high potential if adapters and examples are successfully delivered. Overall assessment is moderate to strong, conditional on a concrete integration plan and upstream PRs being committed.

---

## 🔹 **UX Impact**

### **UX Impact Score: 15/20**

### **Rationale:**

The UX problem is clearly defined: recognition and funding flows are fragmented, creating difficulty for both contributors and DAOs. The narrative around the problem is strong, though the proposal would benefit from baseline friction metrics and user research to quantify the severity and provide stronger evidence.

A test/validation plan is present with pilots planned, but success metrics and a feedback loop need to be defined more explicitly. The impact potential is high if these flows become turnkey for DAOs and contributors, addressing a real gap in the public goods ecosystem. Overall assessment is moderate to strong, conditional on a more detailed validation plan being provided.

---

## 🔹 **Product Maturity & Feasibility**

### **Product Maturity & Feasibility Score: 8/15**

### **Rationale:**

The current maturity stage is early to mid, with clear deliverables listed. The scope appears realistic for the Dec 9th deadline if limited to 2 primitives plus quickstart and pilots. A risk section is present, though mitigations should be expanded, particularly around Safe App Store listing timelines which could introduce delays.

Technical feasibility is reasonable with a focused scope and team capacity. The proposal demonstrates awareness of the timeline constraints and has structured the deliverables accordingly. Overall assessment is moderate.

---

## 🔹 **Collaboration**

### **Collaboration Score: 6/10**

### **Rationale:**

The proposal references pilot DAOs as named partners/collaborators, though the names are not legible in the source material. Evidence of partnerships such as MOUs, issues, or letters is not visible and should be added with links. Shared roadmap elements are not shown - the proposal should include a calendar for pilots and listing submissions to demonstrate coordination.

Despite these gaps, the cross-project potential is high given the multi-primitive integrations planned. The proposal would benefit significantly from providing concrete evidence of partnerships and shared planning. Overall assessment is moderate, pending evidence of partnerships.

---

## 🔹 **Team Track Record**

### **Team Track Record Score: 7/10**

### **Rationale:**

The team background and experience includes a Solidity engineer with Safe modules contributions, a Gitcoin onboarding lead, a PM, plus a founder/dev lead. Previous shipped projects include Safe modules contributions, though repo links should be added to verify and showcase this work.

Repository activity and quality information should be provided through GitHub org links and quality signals. Credibility indicators such as references and prior deployments should be included. While the team composition appears strong, the proposal would benefit from more concrete evidence of past work. Overall assessment is moderate to strong, conditional on links and evidence being provided.

---

## 🔹 **Measurement Plan**

### **Measurement Plan Score: 6/10**

### **Rationale:**

Impact metrics are not explicitly defined in the proposal. Recommended KPIs include number of DAOs piloting, number of roles issued via EAS, number of Hypercerts minted, and time-to-recognize contributions. The Karma GAP integration plan shows a GAP link present, but the proposal should define weekly cadence and CIDS mapping.

CIDS framework alignment is identified as Interoperability, Product Growth, and Collaboration. Reporting frequency and detail should be more specific - the proposal should commit to weekly updates and a final report by Dec 9. While the foundation exists, the measurement plan needs more specificity. Overall assessment is moderate.

---

## 🔹 **Budget & Timeline**

### **Budget & Timeline Score: 6/10**

### **Rationale:**

A $5k scenario is presented in the budget, though totals for expanded scope are unclear. Milestone clarity and achievability show a good outline, but acceptance criteria should be defined explicitly, such as EAS schemas merged, example app live, and pilots completed. The timeline to Dec 9th appears achievable if scope is focused.

Acceptance criteria are not yet explicit and should be added per milestone. Risk mitigation and fallback planning are present, though backup primitive choices should be added. While the budget structure is reasonable, clarity on totals and acceptance criteria would strengthen this section. Overall assessment is moderate.

**Conditions/Suggestions:**
- Commit to EAS + Hypercerts integrations with upstream PRs/issues and a working demo
- Publish a quickstart and SDK with copy‑paste templates; aim for Safe App Store submission
- Provide weekly GAP updates mapped to CIDS with defined KPIs

## CIDS Activity Alignment

Which CIDS activity structure(s) does this proposal align with?
- [x] Interoperability
- [x] Product Growth
- [x] Collaboration
- [ ] UI/UX (can be marked if quickstart/docs address UX pain explicitly)

**Notes:** Interoperability‑first proposal with meaningful Collaboration via pilot DAOs; solid Product Growth outcomes if SDK + integrations ship.
