## Key Aspects

### Integration/Development in Question
Funding and incentive infrastructure to surface and reward impactful public‑goods work. Planned integrations include onchain attestations (EAS), Hypercerts, and Safe + Zodiac modules; Superfluid integration is mentioned as potential. Deliverables include onchain user roles/permissions for Impact 2.0, validation workflows, SDK + quickstart, and publishing to Safe App Store.

### Funding Amount
Scenario shows an amount requested of $5,000 with a breakdown (research/design, engineering, PM). Additional figures for in‑kind or expanded scope appear but totals are not fully legible. Please confirm final total request and per‑category allocations.

### General Impression
Well‑aligned proposal targeting a real gap: making it easier to fund and validate high‑impact contributions across public‑goods ecosystems. Clear intent to ship usable modules/SDK and integrate with widely used primitives (EAS, Hypercerts, Safe/Zodiac). Strong potential if integrations and examples land; budget totals and acceptance criteria need clarification.

### Alignment with Round
- Interoperability: Strong intent with multiple primitives; needs concrete scoped integrations and upstream contributions.
- Collaboration: Mentions DAO pilots and ecosystem partners; provide named pilots and evidence.
- UI/UX: Quickstart site + SDK can improve builder onboarding and recognition workflows.
- Product Maturity: Appears feasible for Dec 9 if scope is focused.

## Proposal Feedback

### What I Like About the Proposal
- Targets funding/recognition flows that many public‑goods teams need
- Integrates recognized primitives (EAS, Hypercerts, Safe/Zodiac) with SDK and app examples
- Clear GTM idea: 2 pilot DAOs, quickstart, Safe App Store listing

### What Can Be Improved or Made More Clear
- Confirm two+ integrations with concrete artifacts and upstream PRs (e.g., EAS schemas, Hypercert adapters)
- Provide an itemized budget with totals and acceptance criteria per milestone
- Name pilot DAOs/partners and share evidence (issues/MOUs/letters)

### Questions
- Which two+ primitives will be fully integrated by Dec 9 and what exactly ships for each (schemas, contracts, SDK adapters, example app, upstream PRs)?
- What is the final total funding request and the per‑category breakdown? What are acceptance criteria per milestone?
- Which DAOs will pilot Impact 2.0 roles/validation flows? What commitments/evidence can you share?

## Rubric-Based Analysis

### Interoperability (25 points)
**Focus:** Concrete plan + credible execution path to adopt at least 2 primitives; evidence of upstream contributions (schemas, PRs).

**Analysis:**
- Primitives being integrated: EAS, Hypercerts, Safe + Zodiac (explicit); Superfluid potential.
- Execution credibility: Reasonable; needs task list per primitive and links to upstream engagement.
- Upstream contribution evidence: Not shown; propose EAS schema PRs and Hypercert examples.
- Strength of interoperability approach: High potential if adapters and examples land.

**Assessment:** Moderate → Strong (with concrete integration plan + PRs)

---

### UX Impact (20 points)
**Focus:** Clear definition of the UX problem (onboarding, account abstraction, safety, gas, dev‑ex, privacy, etc.), severity evidence, and test plan.

**Analysis:**
- UX problem clearly defined: Recognition/funding flows are fragmented; difficulty for contributors and DAOs.
- Severity and evidence: Narrative strong; add baseline friction metrics and user research.
- Test/validation plan: Pilots planned; define success metrics and feedback loop.
- Impact potential: High if flows become turnkey for DAOs and contributors.

**Assessment:** Moderate → Strong (with validation plan)

---

### Product Maturity & Feasibility (15 points)
**Focus:** TRL‑style stage mapping with realistic scope for 4‑6 weeks; risk register & mitigations.

**Analysis:**
- Current maturity stage: Early to mid; clear deliverables listed.
- Scope realistic for Dec 9th deadline: Feasible if limited to 2 primitives + quickstart + pilots.
- Risks identified and mitigated: Risk section present; expand mitigations (e.g., Safe App Store listing timelines).
- Technical feasibility: Reasonable with focused scope and team capacity.

**Assessment:** Moderate

---

### Collaboration (10 points)
**Focus:** Named integration partners; MOUs/issues opened; co‑maintenance or shared roadmaps.

**Analysis:**
- Named partners/collaborators: Pilot DAOs referenced; names not legible.
- Evidence of partnerships (MOUs, issues, etc.): Not visible; add links.
- Shared roadmap elements: Not shown; propose calendar for pilots and listing submissions.
- Cross‑project potential: High given multi‑primitive integrations.

**Assessment:** Moderate (pending evidence)

---

### Team Track Record (10 points)
**Focus:** Repos, releases, audits, shipped infra; Proof‑of‑Ship track record.

**Analysis:**
- Team background and experience: Includes Solidity engineer with Safe modules contributions, Gitcoin onboarding lead, PM; plus founder/dev lead.
- Previous shipped projects: Safe modules contributions referenced; add repo links.
- Repository activity and quality: Provide GitHub org links and quality signals.
- Credibility indicators: Provide references and prior deployments.

**Assessment:** Moderate → Strong (with links)

---

### Measurement Plan (10 points)
**Focus:** Which onchain/offchain metrics will be emitted; EAS schemas; Hypercert minting cadence; reporting via OpenGrants/Karma GAP.

**Analysis:**
- Impact metrics defined: Not explicit; recommend KPIs (#DAOs piloting, #roles issued via EAS, #Hypercerts minted, time‑to‑recognize contrib).
- Karma GAP integration plan: GAP link present; define weekly cadence and CIDS mapping.
- CIDS framework alignment: Interoperability + Product Growth + Collaboration.
- Reporting frequency and detail: Propose weekly updates and final report by Dec 9.

**Assessment:** Moderate

---

### Budget & Timeline (10 points)
**Focus:** Value for money; milestone clarity; licenses; acceptance criteria; fallback plan.

**Analysis:**
- Budget reasonableness: $5k scenario presented; totals for expanded scope unclear.
- Milestone clarity and achievability: Good outline; define acceptance criteria (e.g., EAS schemas merged, example app live, pilots completed).
- Timeline to Dec 9th: Achievable if scope is focused.
- Acceptance criteria defined: Not yet explicit; add per milestone.
- Risk mitigation/fallback: Present; add backup primitive choices.

**Assessment:** Moderate

## Summary

### Standout Strengths
1. High‑value problem: funding/recognition workflows for public‑goods contributors
2. Multiple recognized primitives targeted with SDK/quickstart deliverables
3. Practical GTM path (2 pilot DAOs + Safe App Store listing)

### Key Concerns / Red Flags
1. Concrete interop plan and upstream contributions not linked
2. Budget totals/acceptance criteria need clarity
3. Pilot partners not named with evidence

### Critical Questions for Builder
1. Which two+ primitives will be integrated by Dec 9, and what concrete artifacts ship (schemas, adapters, demo, PRs)?
2. What is the final total requested and itemized budget per milestone, with acceptance criteria?
3. Which DAOs will pilot, and what commitment evidence can you share?

---

## Final Recommendation

**Conviction Level:** Medium (conditional)

**Rationale:** Strong alignment and potential ecosystem leverage across recognition and funding flows. Recommend funding contingent on concrete integrations, budget clarity, and pilot evidence.

**Conditions/Suggestions:**
- Commit to EAS + Hypercerts integrations with upstream PRs/issues and a working demo
- Publish a quickstart and SDK with copy‑paste templates; aim for Safe App Store submission
- Provide weekly GAP updates mapped to CIDS with defined KPIs

---

## CIDS Activity Alignment

Which CIDS activity structure(s) does this proposal align with?
- [x] Interoperability
- [x] Product Growth
- [x] Collaboration
- [ ] UI/UX (can be marked if quickstart/docs address UX pain explicitly)

**Notes:** Interoperability‑first proposal with meaningful Collaboration via pilot DAOs; solid Product Growth outcomes if SDK + integrations ship.
