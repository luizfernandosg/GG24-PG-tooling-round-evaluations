## Key Aspects

### Integration/Development in Question
Build on OpenLitterMap to launch "LitterWeek" campaign and related public-goods initiatives. Deliverables include: (1) Launch OLMv5 - major AI-transformation of OpenLitterMap (ongoing PR #668); (2) Build LitterWeek MVP and get first users; (3) Revisit Littercoin smart contract, get it audited, and run testnet experiments. The proposal focuses on creating a modern internet onboarding experience that teaches people how to use new technologies through citizen science litter mapping.

### Funding Amount
$10,000 requested. Budget breakdown not detailed in proposal - proposer mentions hiring developers and community/socials/strategy roles with this funding. The proposal mentions a pre-seed target of $420,069, with ~$20,000 raised from Cardano and $5,000 from Gitcoin previously.

### General Impression
Strong, mission-aligned project with demonstrated traction in citizen science and open data. OpenLitterMap is a recognized Digital Public Good by the UN-endorsed Digital Public Goods Alliance, with 8,763+ users organically signed up. Clear community/public benefit and education angle. However, technical interoperability plans and precise budget/timeline require clarification. The proposal mentions Karma GAP integration but doesn't specify concrete integrations with 2+ recognized primitives.

### Alignment with Round
- Interoperability: Weak - only mentions Karma GAP integration, no concrete plan for 2+ primitives
- Collaboration: Weak - mentions 8,763+ users and Uganda initiative but no named partners or evidence
- UI/UX: Moderate - addresses onboarding and education UX through LitterWeek campaign
- Product Maturity: Moderate - has existing platform but scope to Dec 9 must be tightened

## Proposal Feedback

### What I Like About the Proposal
- Clear public good with visible community and education impact
- Recognized Digital Public Good by UN-endorsed Digital Public Goods Alliance
- Existing platform with 8,763+ organic users demonstrates traction
- Concrete deliverables (OLMv5 launch, LitterWeek MVP, Littercoin audit)
- Strong academic credibility with published research

### What Can Be Improved or Made More Clear
- Specify at least 2 concrete integrations with recognized primitives (e.g., EAS, Hypercerts, OpenGrants, Aragon/Snapshot, Karma GAP specifics)
- Provide an itemized budget with totals and acceptance criteria per milestone; align to Dec 9th
- Clarify the UX pain point(s) and how LitterWeek addresses them (who, what friction, how measured)
- Name specific partners for LitterWeek (schools, municipalities, NGOs) and provide evidence

### Questions
- What are the two+ primitives you will integrate by Dec 9th? What exactly will ship for each?
- How will success be measured onchain/offchain (metrics, events, EAS schemas, GAP reports)?
- Who are the named partners for LitterWeek (schools, municipalities, NGOs)? Any MOUs/issues/letters?
- What is the detailed budget breakdown and timeline for completing deliverables by Dec 9?

## Rubric-Based Analysis

## 🔹 **Interoperability**

### **Interoperability Score: 15/25**

### **Rationale:**

The proposal mentions Karma GAP integration (profile link provided) but does not specify concrete integrations with 2+ recognized public goods primitives. The deliverables focus on launching OLMv5, building LitterWeek MVP, and revisiting Littercoin smart contract, but there's no explicit plan for integrating with EAS, Hypercerts, or other recognized primitives.

Execution credibility is moderate - the team has experience with OpenLitterMap and mentions ongoing AI transformation work, but concrete integration plans and repo issues/PRs are not provided. Upstream contribution evidence is not specified - the proposal should consider EAS schema proposals or documentation PRs for citizen science data standards.

The strength of the interoperability approach is promising but underspecified. While the proposal addresses impact measurement through Karma GAP, it lacks the concrete 2+ primitive integration plan required for this round. Overall assessment is moderate, pending clarity on specific primitive integrations and upstream contributions.

---

## 🔹 **UX Impact**

### **UX Impact Score: 12/20**

### **Rationale:**

The UX problem is implicitly defined: society is missing a modern internet onboarding experience that can help teach people how to use new and better technologies. The proposal addresses this through LitterWeek campaign that engages people in producing data to unlock in-world educational experiences in technology and the environment.

However, the problem is not explicitly framed with clear severity evidence. The proposal mentions that 5/8 billion people have been connected online with "always-online privacy destroying pocket-wizards and no training," but doesn't provide baseline metrics, user research, or quantitative data about the current state of the problem.

The test/validation plan is not clearly visible - the proposal mentions automated impact reports via Twitter bot and plans for email/marketing campaigns, but doesn't specify before/after adoption metrics or validation approach. Impact potential is high if onboarding friction is reduced and campaigns scale, but the validation plan needs more specificity.

Overall assessment is moderate - strong social impact narrative but weak on explicit problem framing and validation metrics.

---

## 🔹 **Product Maturity & Feasibility**

### **Product Maturity & Feasibility Score: 8/15**

### **Rationale:**

The current maturity stage is existing platform with active usage - OpenLitterMap has 8,763+ users, is recognized as a Digital Public Good, and has ongoing development (OLMv5 AI transformation PR #668). However, the scope for this round includes launching OLMv5, building LitterWeek MVP, and revisiting Littercoin smart contract, which may be ambitious for the Dec 9th deadline.

The scope appears realistic IF narrowed to 2 integrations + campaign kits, but the proposal doesn't clearly scope deliverables to the 4-6 week timeline. Risks are not explicitly listed - the proposal should add risks such as data quality, partner onboarding, dev bandwidth, and Littercoin audit timeline with mitigations.

Technical feasibility feels reasonable given the existing platform and team experience, but confirmation of resourcing for integrations is needed. The proposal mentions hiring developers but doesn't specify timeline or capacity.

Overall assessment is moderate - existing platform provides maturity but scope needs tightening for Dec 9 deadline.

---

## 🔹 **Collaboration**

### **Collaboration Score: 4/10**

### **Rationale:**

The proposal mentions 8,763+ users who have joined organically and a new initiative launching in Uganda soon, but does not provide explicit named partners (schools, city councils, NGOs, citizen science organizations). The collaboration section mentions "8763+ people joined so far growing every day. Launching new initiative in Uganda soon" but lacks specific partner names or evidence.

Evidence of partnerships such as MOUs, issues, or letters is not shown. The proposal should add links or letters demonstrating collaboration commitments. Shared roadmap elements are not visible - there's no joint milestone calendar or coordination plan with partners.

Cross-project potential is high across citizen science and local governments, but needs concrete anchors. The proposal mentions reaching out to "100,000s of small volunteer cleanup organisations around the world" but doesn't specify named partners or commitments.

Overall assessment is weak - signals of partnerships exist but explicit named partners and evidence are missing.

---

## 🔹 **Team Track Record**

### **Team Track Record Score: 6/10**

### **Rationale:**

The team consists of Seán Lynch (Founder, Geographer and Chief Meme Officer) and Katongole Talik (Founder, OpenLitterMap Uganda). The team appears experienced with OpenLitterMap, which is a recognized Digital Public Good with 8,763+ users and academic credibility (published research, Springer Open citations).

Previous shipped projects include OpenLitterMap itself, with GitHub repo provided (github.com/openlittermap). The proposal mentions ongoing AI transformation work (PR #668) and automated impact reports via Twitter bot, demonstrating some shipping capability.

Repository activity and quality should be verified through GitHub links. The proposal provides the GitHub organization link but doesn't show specific recent activity or quality signals. Credibility indicators are strong - Digital Public Good recognition, academic publications, and organic user growth demonstrate community presence.

Overall assessment is moderate - experienced team with proven platform but limited visibility into recent development activity and quality signals.

---

## 🔹 **Measurement Plan**

### **Measurement Plan Score: 6/10**

### **Rationale:**

Impact metrics are not explicitly defined in the proposal. The proposal mentions automated impact reports via Twitter bot (@OLM_bot) and plans for email/marketing campaigns, but doesn't specify KPIs such as events logged, participants, bags collected, geo coverage, or repeat actions.

The Karma GAP integration plan exists - profile link provided (https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/openlittermap-real-time-in-world-open-source-gamification-system) - but the proposal doesn't outline reporting cadence or CIDS framework mapping. The proposal should define weekly updates and final impact report by Dec 9.

CIDS framework alignment likely fits UI/UX and Product Growth categories, possibly Collaboration if partner evidence is provided. The proposal should explicitly map metrics to CIDS categories.

Reporting frequency and detail are not specified - the proposal should define weekly Karma GAP updates with specific metrics and a final impact report by Dec 9.

Overall assessment is moderate - foundation exists with Karma GAP profile but lacks specificity on metrics and reporting cadence.

---

## 🔹 **Budget & Timeline**

### **Budget & Timeline Score: 6/10**

### **Rationale:**

The budget of $10,000 appears reasonable, but totals and breakdown are unclear. The proposal mentions hiring developers and community/socials/strategy roles but doesn't provide an itemized table with totals. The proposal should provide a detailed budget breakdown by category.

Milestone clarity and achievability need improvement - the proposal lists 3 deliverables (OLMv5 launch, LitterWeek MVP, Littercoin audit) but doesn't provide 3-4 milestones with acceptance criteria. The proposal should add specific acceptance criteria for each milestone.

Timeline to Dec 9th appears feasible IF scope is narrowed, but the proposal doesn't explicitly confirm timeline alignment. The proposal mentions OLMv5 is "expected to merge in 2026" which raises concerns about Dec 9 deadline feasibility.

Acceptance criteria are not explicitly shown - the proposal should add acceptance criteria for each deliverable (e.g., OLMv5 merged, LitterWeek MVP live with N users, Littercoin audited and deployed on testnet).

Risk mitigation and fallback planning are not shown - the proposal should include dependency backup plans and risk mitigations.

Overall assessment is moderate - budget appears reasonable but needs clarity on totals, milestones, acceptance criteria, and timeline confirmation.

## Final Recommendation

**Conviction Level:** Medium (conditional)

**Rationale:** Strong alignment with public-good outcomes and credible base product; high potential for community impact. OpenLitterMap is a recognized Digital Public Good with demonstrated traction. However, funding recommended only if concrete interoperability integrations (2+ primitives), budget clarity, collaboration evidence, and timeline confirmation are provided.

**Conditions/Suggestions:**
- Commit to 2 integrations (e.g., Karma GAP + EAS or Hypercerts) with linked issues/PRs
- Provide itemized budget with totals and milestone acceptance criteria
- Share letters/issues/MOUs with named partners; schedule check-in mid-build
- Confirm timeline feasibility - can OLMv5 launch, LitterWeek MVP, and Littercoin audit be completed by Dec 9?
