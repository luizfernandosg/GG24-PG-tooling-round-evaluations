# Evaluation: From OpenLitterMap to LitterWeek & beyond

**Date:** 2025-10-22
**Evaluator:** Luiz Fernando
**Proposal Link:** [Unclear from screenshot]

## Key Aspects

### Integration/Development in Question
Build on OpenLitterMap to launch "LitterWeek" and related public-goods initiatives; create resources, guides, and coordination flows to scale citizen science litter mapping and community action. Integrations appear to include impact reporting via Karma GAP and use of open data/standards for citizen science. Additional primitives mentioned are unclear from the screenshot.

### Funding Amount
$10,000 requested (budget breakdown not detailed in proposal - proposer mentions hiring developers and community/socials/strategy roles with this funding)

### General Impression
Strong, mission-aligned project with demonstrated traction in citizen science and open data. Clear community/public benefit and education angle. Proposal appears thoughtful with deliverables and examples, but technical interoperability plans and precise budget/timeline require clarification.

### Alignment with Round
- Interoperability: Potential if integrating with Karma GAP and other primitives, but concrete integrations are not fully specified.
- Collaboration: Signals of partnerships/citizen science networks; need explicit named partners and evidence links.
- UI/UX: Likely improvements via guides, templates, onboarding; UX problem definition should be made explicit.
- Project Maturity: Project seems active with prior deployments; scope to Dec 9 must be tightened.

## Proposal Feedback

### What I Like About the Proposal
- Clear public good with visible community and education impact
- Concrete deliverables (guides, examples, campaigns) aimed at adoption
- Use of open science/citizen science practices and open data mindset

### What Can Be Improved or Made More Clear
- Specify at least 2 concrete integrations with recognized primitives (e.g., EAS, Hypercerts, OpenGrants, Aragon/Snapshot, Karma GAP specifics)
- Clarify the UX pain point(s) and how LitterWeek addresses them (who, what friction, how measured)
- Provide an itemized budget with totals and acceptance criteria per milestone; align to Dec 9th

### Questions
- What are the two+ primitives you will integrate by Dec 9th? What exactly will ship for each?
- How will success be measured onchain/offchain (metrics, events, EAS schemas, GAP reports)?
- Who are the named partners for LitterWeek (schools, municipalities, NGOs)? Any MOUs/issues/letters?

## Rubric-Based Analysis

### Interoperability (25 points)
**Focus:** Concrete plan + credible execution path to adopt at least 2 primitives; evidence of upstream contributions (schemas, PRs).

**Analysis:**
- Primitives being integrated: Karma GAP (stated/linked). Others are not legible.
- Execution credibility: Team appears experienced; need concrete integration plans and repo issues/PRs.
- Upstream contribution evidence: Not specified; consider EAS schema proposals or docs PRs.
- Strength of interoperability approach: Promising, but underspecified in screenshot.

**Assessment:** Moderate (pending clarity)

---

### UX Impact (20 points)
**Focus:** Clear definition of the UX problem (onboarding, account abstraction, safety, gas, dev-ex, privacy, etc.), severity evidence, and test plan.

**Analysis:**
- UX problem clearly defined: Implicitly community onboarding to citizen-science action; not explicitly framed.
- Severity and evidence: Impact claims are strong socially; need user research or baseline data.
- Test/validation plan: Not visible; add before/after adoption metrics and feedback loops.
- Impact potential: High if onboarding friction is reduced and campaigns scale.

**Assessment:** Moderate

---

### Product Maturity & Feasibility (15 points)
**Focus:** TRL-style stage mapping with realistic scope for 4-6 weeks; risk register & mitigations.

**Analysis:**
- Current maturity stage: Existing platform with active usage (inference from OpenLitterMap status).
- Scope realistic for Dec 9th deadline: Likely, if narrowed to 2 integrations + campaign kits.
- Risks identified and mitigated: Not listed; add risks (data quality, partner onboarding, dev bandwidth) with mitigations.
- Technical feasibility: Feels reasonable; confirm resourcing for integrations.

**Assessment:** Moderate

---

### Collaboration (10 points)
**Focus:** Named integration partners; MOUs/issues opened; co-maintenance or shared roadmaps.

**Analysis:**
- Named partners/collaborators: Not legible; list explicit partners (schools, city councils, NGOs, citizen science orgs).
- Evidence of partnerships (MOUs, issues, etc.): Not shown; add links or letters.
- Shared roadmap elements: Not visible.
- Cross-project potential: High across citizen science and local govs; needs concrete anchors.

**Assessment:** Weak → Moderate (if evidence added)

---

### Team Track Record (10 points)
**Focus:** Repos, releases, audits, shipped infra; Proof-of-Ship track record.

**Analysis:**
- Team background and experience: Founder/team listed; appears experienced with OpenLitterMap.
- Previous shipped projects: OpenLitterMap itself; link repos/releases.
- Repository activity and quality: Not shown; add GitHub links.
- Credibility indicators: Community presence is strong; provide references.

**Assessment:** Moderate

---

### Measurement Plan (10 points)
**Focus:** Which onchain/offchain metrics will be emitted; EAS schemas; Hypercert minting cadence; reporting via OpenGrants/Karma GAP.

**Analysis:**
- Impact metrics defined: Not explicit; propose KPIs (events logged, participants, bags collected, geo coverage, repeat actions).
- Karma GAP integration plan: GAP profile exists; outline cadence and CIDS mapping.
- CIDS framework alignment: Likely UI/UX + Product Growth; possibly Collaboration.
- Reporting frequency and detail: Define weekly updates and final impact report by Dec 9.

**Assessment:** Moderate (needs specificity)

---

### Budget & Timeline (10 points)
**Focus:** Value for money; milestone clarity; licenses; acceptance criteria; fallback plan.

**Analysis:**
- Budget reasonableness: Appears reasonable; totals unclear. Provide itemized table with totals.
- Milestone clarity and achievability: Add 3-4 milestones with acceptance criteria.
- Timeline to Dec 9th: Feasible if scope is narrowed.
- Acceptance criteria defined: Not shown; add for each milestone.
- Risk mitigation/fallback: Not shown; include dependency backup plans.

**Assessment:** Moderate (pending budget clarity)

## Summary

### Standout Strengths
1. Strong public-good impact through citizen science and education
2. Existing platform/use (OpenLitterMap) provides maturity and credibility
3. Practical deliverables (guides/campaign kits) likely to drive adoption

### Key Concerns / Red Flags
1. Concrete interoperability plan (2+ primitives) not clearly specified
2. Total budget and milestone acceptance criteria unclear
3. Collaboration evidence (named partners, MOUs, issues) not shown

### Critical Questions for Builder
1. Which two+ primitives will be integrated by Dec 9th, and what will ship for each?
2. What is the total funding request and detailed budget by category? Include acceptance criteria.
3. Who are the named partners for LitterWeek, and what evidence of collaboration can you share?

## Final Recommendation

**Conviction Level:** Medium (conditional)

**Rationale:** Strong alignment with public-good outcomes and credible base product; high potential for community impact. Funding recommended if concrete interoperability integrations, budget clarity, and collaboration evidence are provided.

**Conditions/Suggestions:**
- Commit to 2 integrations (e.g., Karma GAP + EAS or Hypercerts) with linked issues/PRs
- Provide itemized budget with totals and milestone acceptance criteria
- Share letters/issues/MOUs with named partners; schedule check-in mid-build

---

## CIDS Activity Alignment

Which CIDS activity structure(s) does this proposal align with?
- [x] Interoperability (conditional on integrations)
- [x] Collaboration (conditional on partner evidence)
- [x] UI/UX (onboarding resources and guides)
- [x] Product Growth

**Notes:** Strong fit if interoperability specifics and collaboration evidence are clarified; otherwise treat primarily as UI/UX + Product Growth.
