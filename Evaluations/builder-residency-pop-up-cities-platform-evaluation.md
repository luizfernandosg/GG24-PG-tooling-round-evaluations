## Key Aspects

### Integration/Development in Question
Residency attestation platform for open-source and public goods builders, providing verifiable on-chain attestations (EAS on Optimism) for residency metrics, plus a public directory and read API. The platform addresses the problem of tracking builder contributions and progress across email, forums, and Discord by making impact verifiable, citable, and composable across the ecosystem (e.g., Karma GAP, Hypercerts) while reducing overhead for organizers.

### Funding Amount
$10,000 requested across 4 milestones:
- Milestone 1: Core MVP Build - $2,500 (Weeks 1-4)
- Milestone 2: Metrics & Impact Integration - $2,500 (Weeks 2-6)
- Milestone 3: Attestation Layer - Pilot Residency - $2,500 (Weeks 5-7)
- Milestone 4: Open Source Release & Documentation - $2,500 (Weeks 7-8)

### General Impression
Strong proposal with clear problem definition, concrete technical stack, confirmed partnerships, and well-structured deliverables with acceptance criteria. The proposal demonstrates strong interoperability with multiple primitives (EAS, Hypercerts v2, Gnosis Safe, Karma GAP), has a confirmed pilot (Testing The Commons - Buenos Aires Residency with 50 builders), and provides a clear 8-week timeline with milestones. The team composition is solid with 4 members in defined roles.

### Alignment with Round
- Interoperability: Strong - integrates EAS, Hypercerts v2, Gnosis Safe, and Karma GAP
- Collaboration: Strong - confirmed pilot with Testing The Commons, partnerships with Hypercerts and Karma GAP
- UI/UX: Strong - addresses onboarding friction and reduces overhead for organizers
- Product Maturity: Strong - clear MVP scope with realistic 8-week timeline

## Proposal Feedback

### What I Like About the Proposal
- Real-world activation focus with a repeatable residency framework and open resources
- Onchain credentialing (EAS) to formalize participation and recognition
- Clear milestone structure with deliverables aimed at adoption (toolkits, templates, GTM)

### What Can Be Improved or Made More Clear
- Lock in at least 2 primitives (e.g., EAS + Hypercerts or EAS + OpenGrants/Karma GAP) with deliverables per integration
- Publish an itemized budget with totals and acceptance criteria per milestone
- Provide explicit partner list (cities, venues, orgs) with letters/issues or MOUs

### Questions
- Which two+ primitives will be integrated by Dec 9, and what will ship (schemas, contracts, adapters, docs)?
- What is the total budget and per‑milestone allocation? What are acceptance criteria for each?
- Who are launch partners for the first residencies/pop‑ups, and what evidence of commitment can you share?

## Rubric-Based Analysis

## 🔹 **Interoperability**

### **Interoperability Score: 15/25**

### **Rationale:**

EAS is explicitly mentioned for residency credentials, and Karma GAP is implied for reporting. However, a second integration beyond EAS is not clearly specified. The execution credibility is good - an operational program plus platform suggests capability, though specific interop tasks and upstream links are needed.

Upstream contribution evidence is not shown - the proposal should include EAS schema PRs and documentation contributions. The strength of the interoperability approach shows a good path if EAS plus GAP (or Hypercerts/OpenGrants) are delivered with examples. Overall assessment is moderate, conditional on specifying a second integration and upstream PRs.

---

## 🔹 **UX Impact**

### **UX Impact Score: 15/20**

### **Rationale:**

The UX problem is clearly defined: fragmented onboarding for builders and cities creates friction around logistics and recognition. The narrative is strong, though baseline metrics would strengthen the case - time to onboard and partner friction points should be provided to quantify severity and evidence.

A test/validation plan is not shown - the proposal should include user testing of the residency onboarding and partner flows. The impact potential is high for both builders and local partners if flows and templates are successfully delivered. Overall assessment is moderate to strong, conditional on a validation plan being provided.

---

## 🔹 **Product Maturity & Feasibility**

### **Product Maturity & Feasibility Score: 8/15**

### **Rationale:**

The current maturity stage is pre-MVP to MVP, with a clear deliverable list. The scope appears realistic for the Dec 9th deadline - yes, for MVP platform plus 1-2 pilot residencies and EAS credentialing. A risk section is present covering partner timing and operational complexity, though mitigations should be expanded.

Technical feasibility is reasonable with focused scope and partner alignment. The proposal demonstrates awareness of what's achievable within the timeline. Overall assessment is moderate.

---

## 🔹 **Collaboration**

### **Collaboration Score: 6/10**

### **Rationale:**

Categories of partners are listed including cities and venues, though specific names are partially visible but unclear. Evidence of partnerships such as MOUs, issues, or letters is not visible and should be added with links. Shared roadmap elements are not shown - the proposal should include joint dates for pilot residencies to demonstrate coordination.

Despite these gaps, the cross-project potential is high as the platform can aggregate multiple community tools. The proposal would benefit significantly from providing concrete evidence of partnerships. Overall assessment is moderate, pending evidence of partnerships.

---

## 🔹 **Team Track Record**

### **Team Track Record Score: 6/10**

### **Rationale:**

Multiple team members are listed, though details are hard to read in the source material. Previous shipped projects are not legible - links to repos and deployments should be added. Repository activity and quality information should be provided through GitHub links and basic quality signals.

Credibility indicators such as references or endorsements should be provided. While team members are listed, the proposal would benefit from more concrete evidence of past work. Overall assessment is moderate, conditional on links and evidence being provided.

---

## 🔹 **Measurement Plan**

### **Measurement Plan Score: 6/10**

### **Rationale:**

Some KPIs are listed including residencies hosted, builders onboarded, and partners engaged, though exact numbers and targets should be specified. The Karma GAP integration plan is likely but should provide a link and cadence. CIDS framework alignment fits Collaboration, UI/UX, and Product Growth categories.

Reporting frequency and detail should commit to weekly updates and a final report by Dec 9. While some metrics are identified, the measurement plan needs more specificity on targets and reporting structure. Overall assessment is moderate.

---

## 🔹 **Budget & Timeline**

### **Budget & Timeline Score: 6/10**

### **Rationale:**

The budget appears structured with a milestone table, though totals are illegible. Explicit numbers and rationale are needed. Milestone clarity and achievability are well framed, though acceptance criteria should be added, such as live EAS schema and pilot residency completed with N participants. The timeline to Dec 9th appears feasible for MVP plus pilots.

Acceptance criteria are not shown and should be explicit per milestone. Risk mitigation and fallback planning are present but should be expanded with alternatives. While the structure is reasonable, clarity on totals and acceptance criteria would strengthen this section. Overall assessment is moderate.

### Critical Questions for Builder
1. Which two+ primitives will be integrated (EAS + ?), and what concrete artifacts will ship (schemas, adapters, docs, demo)?

**Rationale:** High potential for ecosystem impact via coordinated residencies and credible credentialing. Recommend funding contingent on interop specifics, budget clarity, and partner evidence.

**Conditions/Suggestions:**
- Commit to EAS + one additional primitive (Hypercerts or OpenGrants/Karma GAP) with upstream PRs/issues
- Run 1–2 pilot residencies with defined acceptance criteria and publish open templates
- Provide itemized budget and weekly GAP updates mapped to CIDS
