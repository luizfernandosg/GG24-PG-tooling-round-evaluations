## Key Aspects

### Integration/Development in Question
Integration of Prosperity Pass and Super Accounts Account Levels into Divvi's Proof of Impact campaign, generating User Quality Score that labels onchain transactions to account levels. Deliverables: (1) Finalize Prosperity Pass Account API allowing third-party apps to leverage account data - accepted when initial market-ready Prosperity Pass API launched and documents shared; (2) Complete Divvi User Quality Score Integration for both Prosperity Pass and Super Accounts - accepted when successful MVP of Divvi User Quality Score for both Prosperity Pass and Super Accounts.

### Funding Amount
$11,000 requested ($1,000 design, $1,000 testing, $6,000 engineering, $3,000 project management)

### General Impression
Well-scoped integration proposal building on existing Prosperity Pass and Super Accounts infrastructure (3.5K Prosperity Pass users, 125K Super Accounts users). Clear focus on improving ecosystem growth program efficiency. Good integration with Divvi and CeloPG ecosystem. Active partnerships with Celo (CeloPG) and Optimism (Superchain Eco). However, doesn't explicitly address interoperability with 2+ primitives beyond EAS mentioned in tech stack. Budget ($11,000) is higher than average.

### Alignment with Round
- Interoperability: Moderate - integrates EAS (mentioned), Safe{Core}, Safe SDK, but focus is on API development and Divvi integration
- Collaboration: Good - active partnership with Celo through CeloPG, Optimism through Superchain Eco, planned integration with Divvi and Talent
- UI/UX: Good - addresses user quality assessment UX for growth programs
- Product Maturity: Good - has existing infrastructure with active users, realistic scope

## Rubric-Based Analysis

## 🔹 **Interoperability**

### **Interoperability Score: 19/25**

### **Rationale:**

The proposal mentions EAS (attestations) in the tech stack and integrates Safe{Core} and Safe SDK, but the focus is on API development and Divvi integration rather than explicit primitive integrations. The proposal doesn't explicitly meet the 2+ primitive requirement with detailed integration plans - EAS is mentioned but not detailed in deliverables, and Safe{Core}/Safe SDK are infrastructure components rather than recognized public goods primitives for this round.

Execution credibility is high - the proposal has existing infrastructure (Prosperity Pass with 3.5K users, Super Accounts with 125K users), clear technical approach, and active ecosystem partnerships (CeloPG, Superchain Eco). However, the interoperability plan needs more specificity on what EAS integration will be delivered and what other primitives will be integrated.

Upstream contribution evidence is not explicitly committed - the proposal should specify contributions to EAS, Safe ecosystem, or other primitives. The strength of the interoperability approach is moderate - API enables third-party adoption but doesn't explicitly commit to multiple primitive integrations with upstream contributions.

Overall assessment is moderate to strong - good infrastructure foundation but needs explicit 2+ primitive integration plan with acceptance criteria.

## 🔹 **UX Impact**

### **UX Impact Score: 15/20**

### **Rationale:**

The UX problem is clearly defined: the pseudonymous nature of blockchain networks makes it challenging to identify and empower key contributors, leading to most programs prioritizing low-value contributions (simple app clicks) over long-term, high-value contributions that drive real value and development. User Quality Score enables better prioritization by labeling onchain transactions to account levels.

Severity and evidence are strong - the narrative clearly articulates how current systems favor clicks over meaningful contributions, creating misaligned incentives. The proposal mentions that User Quality Score will improve efficiency of onchain growth programs and function as incentive to promote wider Celo dApp usage and sign of quality for emerging apps.

The test/validation plan mentions Divvi integration powering Proof of Impact program (with remaining budget of over $100K in CELO and OP tokens) but doesn't specify success metrics or validation approach. The proposal should define KPIs such as API users, quality scores generated, impact on growth programs, or improvement in contribution quality.

Impact potential is high - improves ecosystem growth program efficiency, enables better user prioritization, and incentivizes wider dApp usage. Overall assessment is moderate to strong - clear problem with strong narrative, but validation plan needs more specificity.

---

## 🔹 **Product Maturity & Feasibility**

### **Product Maturity & Feasibility Score: 13/15**

### **Rationale:**

The current maturity stage is production - the proposal has Prosperity Pass (3.5K users) and Super Accounts (125K users) live, existing infrastructure, and proven execution capability. The scope for this round is API development and integration work, which are feasible for the Dec 9th deadline.

The scope appears realistic - API finalization and Divvi integration are incremental improvements building on existing infrastructure. However, timeline to Dec 9th is not explicitly confirmed - the proposal should confirm timeline aligns with Dec 9 deadline.

Risks are mentioned but not explicitly detailed - the proposal mentions "working closely with the Divvi team and having regular stand-ups and check-ins" but doesn't provide explicit risk register covering integration complexity, API stability, or timeline compression. Technical feasibility is high - builds on existing infrastructure, clear technical approach, realistic scope, and experienced team.

Overall assessment is strong - production platform with realistic incremental improvements, conditional on timeline confirmation.

---

## 🔹 **Collaboration**

### **Collaboration Score: 7/10**

### **Rationale:**

The proposal demonstrates good collaboration through active partnerships with Celo (CeloPG) and Optimism (Superchain Eco), and planned integration with Divvi and Talent. The proposal mentions leveraging existing CeloPG (1.6K users) and Superchain Eco (15.9K users) communities, and targeting 3.5K Prosperity Pass and 125K Super Accounts users.

However, evidence of partnerships such as MOUs, issues, or letters is not provided - the proposal mentions "active partnerships" and "planned integration" but doesn't provide evidence of Divvi collaboration commitment or MOUs. The proposal should add evidence of collaboration commitments.

Shared roadmap elements are not shown - the proposal mentions Divvi integration and Proof of Impact program but doesn't show joint milestone calendar or timeline coordination. Cross-project potential is high - API enables ecosystem-wide adoption, benefits many growth programs, and User Quality Score can be used across ecosystems.

Overall assessment is moderate to strong - good collaboration signals but needs evidence of commitments.

## 🔹 **Team Track Record**

### **Team Track Record Score: 9/10**

### **Rationale:**

The team demonstrates strong background and experience. Luuk (Senior Product Lead) has strong entrepreneurial background, building full-time in Web3 since 2017, previously led Product at PrimeDAO, leads EcoLabs team. Enrique (Design Lead) has 4+ years experience as full-stack Web3 Designer, shipped nearly 20 brands and dApps. Seb (Tech Lead) has 10+ years experience, worked on multiple end-user-facing applications. Luis (Smart Contract Dev) has 10+ ETH Global hackathon prizes, worked with team for 2+ years, shipped over a dozen onchain dApps.

Previous shipped projects include Prosperity Pass (3.5K users), Super Accounts (125K users), multiple onchain dApps, GitHub repos provided (github.com/Superchaineco). The proposal demonstrates proven execution capability with large user bases and deployed products.

Repository activity and quality should be verified - GitHub org provided but should verify current activity and quality signals. Credibility indicators are excellent - large user bases (3.5K + 125K users), hackathon wins, proven execution capability, and active ecosystem presence.

Overall assessment is strong - excellent team credentials with proven execution capability.

---

## 🔹 **Measurement Plan**

### **Measurement Plan Score: 6/10**

### **Rationale:**

Impact metrics are not explicitly defined - the proposal mentions leveraging existing user bases (3.5K Prosperity Pass, 125K Super Accounts) and Proof of Impact program with $100K+ budget, but doesn't specify KPIs such as API users, quality scores generated, impact on growth programs, or improvement in contribution quality.

The Karma GAP integration plan exists - profile link provided (https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/prosperity-pass) - but the proposal doesn't specify reporting cadence or CIDS framework mapping. The proposal should define weekly updates and final impact report by Dec 9.

CIDS framework alignment likely fits Interoperability, UI/UX, and Product Growth categories. The proposal should explicitly map metrics to CIDS categories. Reporting frequency and detail are not specified - the proposal should define weekly Karma GAP updates with specific metrics.

Overall assessment is moderate - foundation exists with Karma GAP profile but lacks specificity on metrics and reporting cadence.

---

## 🔹 **Budget & Timeline**

### **Budget & Timeline Score: 7/10**

### **Rationale:**

The budget of $11,000 is higher than average but breakdown is clear ($1,000 design, $1,000 testing, $6,000 engineering, $3,000 project management). The proposal should justify the higher budget with clear value proposition, especially given the scope is API development and integration work.

Milestone clarity and achievability are good - clear deliverables (D1: API, D2: Divvi integration) with acceptance criteria (market-ready API, successful MVP with both Prosperity Pass and Super Accounts). However, timeline to Dec 9th is not explicitly specified - the proposal should confirm timeline aligns with Dec 9 deadline.

Acceptance criteria are good - specific criteria for each deliverable (market-ready API launched and documents shared, successful MVP with both Prosperity Pass and Super Accounts). Risk mitigation and fallback planning are mentioned (working closely with Divvi team, regular stand-ups) but don't provide explicit risk register.

Overall assessment is moderate to strong - reasonable budget structure with clear deliverables but needs timeline confirmation and budget justification.
