To grow a healthy ecosystem of Public Goods on Ethereum, we need healthy infrastructure for investing and growing the network’s public goods themselves. 

We’ve identified 5 meta-buckets of public goods ecosystem growth infrastructure that communities and projects on Ethereum rely on, along with the top tools and protocols for each of these categories. 

We’re seeking proposals that help make these tools more user-friendly and interoperable, so that communities, projects, and ecosystem growth orgs within Ethereum can make better investments towards their collective purposes. 

_\*this round is not intended for ecosystem-wide infrastructure like Ethereum clients, wallets, and developer tooling. For that, check out the GG24 Developer Tooling Infrastructure round._
