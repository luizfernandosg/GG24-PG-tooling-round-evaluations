## Personal Evaluator Notes

### Silvi SDK: Open and Permissionless Reforestation Infrastructure
**Project Impression:** Highly favorable - big fan of Silvi! Could be more integration-focused vs core improvement

**Comments on Proposal:**
- Seems to be more of product development - Addresses key bottleneck for implementing partners - rather than a PG development to address a key issue of the ecosystem
- I like the idea of making it an SDK for methodology configuration - opening the possibility of adoption by partners/projects with their own methodologies

**Questions:**
- Budget scope: deliverable only or includes followup roadmap?

### WFF: Regenerative Governance Engine
**Project Impression:** Unfavorable overall assessment

**Comments on Proposal:**
- Budget request seems completely out of touch with the proposed scope and the round:
  - Especially as there's only 1 defined person in the team

### The Regen Atlas - Actions View
**Project Impression:** Highly favorable of the project and team!

- Highly favorable assessment of project and team
- Good overall project alignment

**Comments on Proposal:**
- Well detailed proposal
- Need to verify key pain point solutions

### Prosperity Pass <> Divvi - User Quality Score Integration
**Comments on Proposal:**
- Budget seems too high

### Spinach.fi - Daily Retro Funding Competitions For Builders
**Comments on Proposal:**
- Proposal seems to be unclear about what is the actual work involved
- The most representative deliverable seems to be multichain round, but:
  - It lacks basic details about the implementation, such as to what chains it would be deployed to and what would be related work. It also doesn't mention in what chains it's already currently deployed.
  - I don't think multichain deployments should be funded in this pool
