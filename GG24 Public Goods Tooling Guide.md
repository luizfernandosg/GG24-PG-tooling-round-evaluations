Welcome Public Good Tooling Evaluation Council. This is your one page guide to evaluations, with responsibilities, timelines, commitment time and compensation.

## Mission

The goal of the council is to provide **quality** and **insightfu****l** evaluations of public good tooling proposals with a sharp focus on **interoperability**, **UI/UX pain points**, **collaboration** and **project maturity**. Our goal is to provide builders with support and feedback to help them grow and find sustainability.

**Our Theory of Change**:

**If** Ethereum public goods tool builders are connected to diverse forms of [capital](http://appleseedpermaculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/8_Forms_of_Capital_PM68.pdf) to build stronger network effects, foster deeper collaboration, and enhance interoperability across the ecosystem. **Then** public goods tooling will mature more rapidly and gain broader adoption across traditional markets and local communities. **Because** building resilient and impactful tools depends on trust, and trust grows through collective effort.

## Key Dates

- **PG Tooling Round Details Announcement (October 9th)** - This will be our formal announcing of the round to the community and builders 

- **GG24 Round Kickoff (October 14th)** - Launch of Gitcoin Round allocation across all domains

- **PG Tooling Round Kickoff Space (October 15th)** - Twitter space to kickoff the round and communicate core round details and answer questions from builders

- **PG Tooling Showcase #1 (October 16th)** - Tooling featured on interoperability list showcase to builders how to utilize their tools, new updates and provide light tech support. 

- **PG Tooling Showcase #2 (November 13th)** - Final showcase before DevConnect for tooling to share any new updates and potentially feature some of the completed proposals

## Round Phases

1. **Strategy & Planning (July - October 9th)** - Determine partnerships, round structure, evaluations, operational budget and other facets crucial to round success

2. **Marketing & Launch (October 9th - 22nd)**  - Formal promotion of the round to builders and the community, with an opening of the proposal window before allocation kicks off

3. **Round Allocation & Building (October 22nd - December 9th)** - 6 week period for builders to complete milestones in tome for retro allocation

4. **Round Retro (December 9th - 12th)** - Period to review impact reporting and milestone completion to determine retro winners 

## Core Responsibilities

- **Evaluate Growth Pool proposals** - All proposals will be posted on the Greenpill Dev Guild forum with the ones tagged with growth being the ones for you a a council member to review and provide feedback where relevant

- **Place Growth Pool Conviction** - Once the pool opens  you place conviction on proposal on a daily basis for a week with the goal being to allocate most of the pool in a week

- **Present in Tooling Showcase (Optional)** - If you are building tooling on the interoperability list you would like to highlight you can present for 5-10 minutes during the showcase and provide builders with the resources to build and learn

- **Review Proposals For Retro Rewards (Optional)** - If on the small retro evaluation council after the building deadline, you will review impact reports and milestones to determine retro reward winners

## Evaluation Process & Rubric

The rubric is still being finalized, so expect updates over the next few days.

### Growth Pool

1. **Review Proposal Drafts (October 9th - 22nd**) - Engage with growth proposals on Greenpill Dev Guild Charmverse with comments

2. **Discuss Async Proposal Feedback (October 9th - 22nd)** - In Telegram chat discuss proposals, any concerns, standouts etc. in preparation to make an evaluation

3. **Evaluate Proposal With Growth Rubric  (October 15th - 22nd)** - Once GG24 kickoff and the round launched we shift to making evaluations and sharing them with builders, they will default to be private with an opt in to be public

4. **Place Conviction On Proposals  (October 22nd - 31st)** - After evaluations and the 1st office hours the pool will launch and you start placing conviction for the rest of the month

**Tentative Rubric**

- **Interoperability (25)**: Concrete plan + credible execution path to adopt at least 2 primitives; evidence of upstream contributions (schemas, PRs).

- **UX Impact (20)**: Clear definition of the UX problem (onboarding, account abstraction, safety, gas, dev‑ex, privacy, etc.), severity evidence, and test plan.

- **Product Maturity & Feasibility (15)**: TRL‑style stage mapping with realistic scope for 4-6 weeks months; risk register & mitigations.

- **Collaboration (10)**: Named integration partners; MOUs/issues opened; co‑maintenance or shared roadmaps.

- **Team Track Record (10)**: Repos, releases, audits, shipped infra; Proof‑of‑Ship track.

- **Measurement Plan (10)**: Which onchain/offchain metrics will be emitted; EAS schemas; Hypercert minting cadence; reporting via OpenGrants/Karma GAP.

- **Budget & Timeline (10)**: Value for money; milestone clarity; licenses; acceptance criteria; fallback plan.

### Retro Rewards

1. **Review Qualified Retro Proposals (December 9th-10th)** - After building window, if on the retro council you will review impact reports and milestones

2. **Discuss In Sync Proposal Milestones and Reporting (December 10th)** - A dedicated call around 2 hours to deliberate on proposals, discuss any questions/concerns and determine potential winners

3. **Evaluate Proposal With Retro Rubric (December 10th - 11th)** - Complete evaluations of proposals qualified for retro

4. **Announce Retro Rewards (December 12th)** - Final event of the round where we announce the retro winners and a recap of the round and learnings.

**Tentative Rubric**

- **Interoperability Outcomes (35)**: # of live integrations with EAS, Hypercerts, DAOstar, Karma Gap, Octant and other interop protocols/primitives; upstream PRs/standards; composition examples.

- **UI/UX Outcomes (25)**: # of critical UI/UX issues solved and their impact on the end user. Focus on measuring user sentiment on tooling.

- **Usage & Adoption (15)**: tx volume relevant to the tool, distinct integrators, weekly active devs/users, downloads (pkgs), stars growth (normalized).

- **Sustainability & Stewardship (15)**: Maintainer onboarding, triage SLAs, governance handoff; evidence of future roadmap + co‑funding.

- **Docs & Replicability (10)**: Tutorials, examples, migration guides; evidence they were used (referrals/attributions).

## Time Commitment

### Growth Pool

Depending on proposal volume will determine time commitment to a degree, we aim to get around 20-40 applications for the growth pool and allocate to 8-12 projects. Going with a model of **10-20 minutes** per application, 20 proposals **\~3-7hrs**, 40 proposals  **\~7-14hrs.**

Then factoring in the **1 hour council sync**, placing conviction and  optional showcase involvement you're looking at around 6 hour commitment on the low end with 20 proposal and 10 minutes per application and 18hrs on the high end with 40 proposals and 20 minutes per application.

**Breakdown \~6-18hrs**

- **Evaluations (20-40 proposals)**: \~3-14hrs

- **Conviction Voting**: \~1-2hrs

- **Calls**: \~1hr

- **Showcases**: \~1-2hrs

### Retro Rewards

Retro will have a large time commitment over a small window so requires having the bandwidth and availability. Evaluations should be somewhat quicker than the 1st as there will be clear data we're using to make the evaluation and be less subjective since it's based on the impact reporting framework and milestone completion. The core action here is the council to determine the winners of retro rewards.

**Breakdown \~5-11hrs**

- **Evaluations**: \~3-7hrs

- **Retro Voting**: \~2-3hrs

- **Closing Ceremony**: \~1hrs

## Compensation (Still Being Finalized)

Given the complexity in tracking hours we're approaching council comp with a flat fee for the different evaluation flows. All in the initial council will participate in the conviction evaluation but for retro we plan to have a smaller council of **3-5 people** to determine retro rewards. We plan to potentially increase our fair fee to cover more of the cost of the council so we can properly compensate the time being spent.

- **Growth Comp**: $300-400

- **Retro Comp**: $200-300
