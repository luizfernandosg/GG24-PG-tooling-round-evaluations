# Evaluation: Builder Residency + Pop-Up Cities Platform

**Date:** 2025-10-22
**Evaluator:** Luiz Fernando
**Proposal Link:** [Unclear from screenshot]

---

## Key Aspects

### Integration/Development in Question
Platform to coordinate builder residencies and pop-up city activations, matching builders with local partners and venues; includes onboarding flows, residency credentials/attestations, program management, and open resources/templates for cities and communities. Plans to integrate onchain attestations (EAS) for residency credentials and Karma GAP for impact reporting; additional primitives possible but unclear from screenshot.

### Funding Amount
Budget table with multiple milestones is visible, but exact totals and per-line numbers are not fully legible. Please confirm total funding requested and milestone allocations.

### General Impression
Compelling programmatic infrastructure bridging builders with real communities/cities. Clear operational plan (residencies, partners, venues) with open-source resources and measurable activities. Strong collaboration focus. Needs concrete interop deliverables and precise budget/acceptance criteria.

### Alignment with Round
- Interoperability: Promising via EAS credentials and GAP reporting; specify additional integrations and upstream work.
- Collaboration: Core to proposal (cities, venues, partners); provide named partners and evidence.
- UI/UX: Onboarding flows and toolkits can improve community and builder experience.
- Product Maturity: Feels feasible if scoped to MVP + pilot residencies by Dec 9.

## Proposal Feedback

### What I Like About the Proposal
- Real-world activation focus with a repeatable residency framework and open resources
- Onchain credentialing (EAS) to formalize participation and recognition
- Clear milestone structure with deliverables aimed at adoption (toolkits, templates, GTM)

### What Can Be Improved or Made More Clear
- Lock in at least 2 primitives (e.g., EAS + Hypercerts or EAS + OpenGrants/Karma GAP) with deliverables per integration
- Publish an itemized budget with totals and acceptance criteria per milestone
- Provide explicit partner list (cities, venues, orgs) with letters/issues or MOUs

### Questions
- Which two+ primitives will be integrated by Dec 9, and what will ship (schemas, contracts, adapters, docs)?
- What is the total budget and per‑milestone allocation? What are acceptance criteria for each?
- Who are launch partners for the first residencies/pop‑ups, and what evidence of commitment can you share?

## Rubric-Based Analysis

### Interoperability (25 points)
**Focus:** Concrete plan + credible execution path to adopt at least 2 primitives; evidence of upstream contributions (schemas, PRs).

**Analysis:**
- Primitives being integrated: EAS for residency credentials (explicit). Karma GAP implied for reporting. Second integration beyond EAS not clearly specified.
- Execution credibility: Operational program + platform suggests capability; need specific interop tasks and upstream links.
- Upstream contribution evidence: Not shown; propose EAS schema PRs and docs contributions.
- Strength of interoperability approach: Good path if EAS + GAP (or Hypercerts/OpenGrants) are delivered with examples.

**Assessment:** Moderate (conditional on specifying second integration + PRs)

---

### UX Impact (20 points)
**Focus:** Clear definition of the UX problem (onboarding, account abstraction, safety, gas, dev‑ex, privacy, etc.), severity evidence, and test plan.

**Analysis:**
- UX problem clearly defined: Fragmented onboarding for builders and cities; logistics and recognition.
- Severity and evidence: Narrative strong; add baseline metrics (time to onboard, partner friction points).
- Test/validation plan: Not shown; propose user testing of the residency onboarding and partner flows.
- Impact potential: High for both builders and local partners if flows/templates land.

**Assessment:** Moderate → Strong with validation plan

---

### Product Maturity & Feasibility (15 points)
**Focus:** TRL‑style stage mapping with realistic scope for 4‑6 weeks; risk register & mitigations.

**Analysis:**
- Current maturity stage: Pre‑MVP to MVP; clear deliverable list.
- Scope realistic for Dec 9th deadline: Yes, for MVP platform + 1‑2 pilot residencies and EAS credentialing.
- Risks identified and mitigated: Risk section present (partner timing, ops complexity); expand mitigations.
- Technical feasibility: Reasonable with focused scope and partner alignment.

**Assessment:** Moderate

---

### Collaboration (10 points)
**Focus:** Named integration partners; MOUs/issues opened; co‑maintenance or shared roadmaps.

**Analysis:**
- Named partners/collaborators: Categories listed (cities, venues); specific names partially visible but unclear.
- Evidence of partnerships (MOUs, issues, etc.): Not visible; add links/letters.
- Shared roadmap elements: Not shown; propose joint dates for pilot residencies.
- Cross‑project potential: High; can aggregate multiple community tools.

**Assessment:** Moderate (pending evidence)

---

### Team Track Record (10 points)
**Focus:** Repos, releases, audits, shipped infra; Proof‑of‑Ship track record.

**Analysis:**
- Team background and experience: Multiple team members listed; details hard to read.
- Previous shipped projects: Not legible; add links to repos and deployments.
- Repository activity and quality: Provide GitHub links and basic quality signals.
- Credibility indicators: Provide references/endorsements.

**Assessment:** Moderate (needs links)

---

### Measurement Plan (10 points)
**Focus:** Which onchain/offchain metrics will be emitted; EAS schemas; Hypercert minting cadence; reporting via OpenGrants/Karma GAP.

**Analysis:**
- Impact metrics defined: Some KPIs listed (residencies hosted, builders onboarded, partners engaged); specify exact numbers/targets.
- Karma GAP integration plan: Likely; provide link and cadence.
- CIDS framework alignment: Collaboration + UI/UX + Product Growth.
- Reporting frequency and detail: Propose weekly updates and final report by Dec 9.

**Assessment:** Moderate

---

### Budget & Timeline (10 points)
**Focus:** Value for money; milestone clarity; licenses; acceptance criteria; fallback plan.

**Analysis:**
- Budget reasonableness: Appears structured with milestone table; totals illegible. Need explicit numbers and rationale.
- Milestone clarity and achievability: Well framed; add acceptance criteria (e.g., live EAS schema, pilot residency completed with N participants).
- Timeline to Dec 9th: Feasible for MVP + pilots.
- Acceptance criteria defined: Not shown; should be explicit per milestone.
- Risk mitigation/fallback: Present; expand with alternatives.

**Assessment:** Moderate

## Summary

### Standout Strengths
1. Strong real‑world activation and collaboration focus with repeatable residency model
2. Onchain credentialing via EAS to formalize participation and portability
3. Clear milestone structure and GTM components (toolkits, partner outreach)

### Key Concerns / Red Flags
1. Second interop primitive and upstream contribution plan not specified
2. Total budget and acceptance criteria per milestone unclear
3. Evidence of partner commitments not linked

### Critical Questions for Builder
1. Which two+ primitives will be integrated (EAS + ?), and what concrete artifacts will ship (schemas, adapters, docs, demo)?
2. What is the total amount requested and the itemized milestone budget with acceptance criteria?
3. Who are the launch partners (cities, venues), and what evidence can you share (letters/MOUs/issues)?

## Final Recommendation

**Conviction Level:** Medium (conditional)

**Rationale:** High potential for ecosystem impact via coordinated residencies and credible credentialing. Recommend funding contingent on interop specifics, budget clarity, and partner evidence.

**Conditions/Suggestions:**
- Commit to EAS + one additional primitive (Hypercerts or OpenGrants/Karma GAP) with upstream PRs/issues
- Run 1–2 pilot residencies with defined acceptance criteria and publish open templates
- Provide itemized budget and weekly GAP updates mapped to CIDS

## CIDS Activity Alignment

Which CIDS activity structure(s) does this proposal align with?
- [x] Collaboration
- [x] UI/UX (onboarding flows, toolkits)
- [x] Product Growth
- [x] Interoperability (conditional on second integration)

**Notes:** Strong Collaboration and UX focus; Interoperability strengthens with an additional primitive and upstream contributions.
