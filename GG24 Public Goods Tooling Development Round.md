Welcome to your one page guide to the Gitcoin Grant Round 24 **Public Good Tooling Development Round** under the Public Goods R&D domain.

---

# How To Participate

The round is split into two paths, **pilot** and **growth** with both focused on the round goals. Each pool uses **[Conviction Voting](https://convictionvoting.wtf/)**, a time based vote. Funded proposals in both pools are eligible for **Retro** **Rewards,** a performance based bonus.

> Heads up, this page will be updated as the Pilot and Growth **funding pools are setup** on Gardens, the **impact reporting framework finalized**, and **retro rewards determined**.

### Who is this for?

- **Builders of public goods infrastructure on Ethereum**, including capital formation, capital allocation, identity/reputation, impact measurement, and any other tooling that public goods communities count on to effectively fund and coordinate their purpose.

- **Aspiring public goods builders** looking to connect with the best in the public goods space, either to join an existing project or to fund their own idea for a tool or application build.

### Round Goals

- **Increase Interoperability** - Support projects integrating with shared public goods primitives

- **Create Collaborations** - Prioritize teams demonstrating clear cross-project partnerships or co-development

- **Improve UI/UX** - Fund solutions addressing key public goods UX challenges (for example, community onboarding, identity, or privacy)

- **Grow Project Maturity** - Back projects with an active roadmap that clearly moves tooling toward their next phase of growth

### Procrastinators Beware

**Impact Reporting is due ******December 9th******, and Retro Funding will be based on performance of the work completed to that point****. **Make sure to scope your proposal to complete within the time window********. **L****ess is more. **

### Application Process

1. Decide what pool to apply for funding **(you can only select one)**

2. Draft a proposal on the [Greenpill Dev Guild Proposal Page](https://app.charmverse.io/greenpill-dev-guild/proposals)

3. Submit final proposal on [Gardens platform](https://app.gardens.fund/gardens) **(cannot be edited once submitted)**

4. Wait to grow enough conviction from the Evaluation Council for your proposal to pass

### Impact Reporting (More Details Soon)

To track progress and measure impact each proposal will require a Karma GAP project to report their activities and milestones. The round will utilize the [Common Impact Data Standard (CIDS)](https://www.commonapproach.org/common-impact-data-standard/) framework for activity reporting which consists of **deliverables** and **metrics.**

The round consists of 4 CIDS activity report structures: 

- **Interoperability**

- **Collaboration**

- **UI/UX**

- **Product Growth**
