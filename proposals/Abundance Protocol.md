### Problem Being Solved

Solving a fundamental coordination problem: how do you incentivize developers to work on the most impactful public goods infrastructure, while allowing the network to surface the most impactful work to be funded

### Project Tech Stack

- Next.js

- Divvi

- WalletConnect

### Collaborations

Potential integrations: Superfluid (as funding mechanism for Impact); Celo PG, GreenWill/Regenerative Stack, EAS, KarmaGap (Impact can help with sensemaking - surfacing impactful projects and assigning reputation/value); Hypercerts (creating onchain "curation" for medium/larger projects posted on Farcaster)

### Deliverables

- D1: Complete User Roles for Impact 2.0 - allow users to choose roles (validator, supporter, curator, booster) - fully integrated with point system _→ accepted after verification of new user sign ups and roles selected in the system_

### Budget

- _Amount Requested: $8,000_

  - Engineering & design: $4,500

  - Marketing & onboarding: $2,500

  - Infra costs: $1,000

### GTM & Adoption Plan

- Onboard users (curators, contributors, validators) through Impact 2.0 (Farcaster miniapp) - there are two target groups: 1) members of public goods-aligned communities (Celo, GP, Octant, etc) interested in testing alternative allocation mechanisms and new ways to surface valuable projects in their ecosystem. 2) Farcaster-centered users who are interested in increasing signal-to-noise ratio on the protocol.

- Review use data and user feedback and incorporate changes into the app while building out more features of the protocol.

- Add features that solve common user pain-points in social media (related to signal-to-noise, surfacing quality content, visibility of new users, etc.) thus creating more value for users and facilitating adoption of the system.

- Use the built in boosting feature in the app to further promote the system on Farcaster

- Grow social media presence with The Crypto Revolution publication & posts, which outlines the problems we're solving and why they're important for users
