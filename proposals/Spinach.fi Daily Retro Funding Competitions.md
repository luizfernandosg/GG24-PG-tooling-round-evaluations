## Welcome To The Growth Pool Proposal Form

This form gathers the key details of your proposal to be shared to the community and provide the evaluation council key information to evaluate your proposal.

**Who's this Pool for?**

- Experienced builders with an idea addressing a critical infrastructure need

- Builders of existing public good tooling looking to become more interoperable

**Here are the step you will take:**

1. **Fill Out From** - Provide a detailed yet concise overview of your proposal.

2. **Community Feedback** - Address feedback and questions from the community and evaluators.

3. **Gardens Submission** - Once feedback is addressed, publish proposal on Gardens platform with the funding amount, title, problem being solved and Charmverse proposal link.

Once submitted to Gardens, the Evaluation Council will review your proposal and then support proposals on Gardens. You'll be able to see evaluation feedback on Charmverse and conviction growing on Gardens.

### What categories of public goods does your proposal address?

Capital Allocation, Capital Formation, Impact Measurement

### Problem Being Solved

Funding for builders is hard, especially for those creating public goods or infrastructure that benefit everyone but don’t generate direct revenue. Meanwhile, liquidity incentives in DeFi are often misaligned: they flow to end users or whales who withdraw liquidity as soon as rewards stop. This short-term dynamic weakens ecosystems and creates poor UX for builders trying to grow sustainable liquidity.

**Spinach** addresses this by improving the builder funding experience and liquidity UX across ecosystems. Instead of rewarding mercenary users, Spinach runs **daily retroactive funding competitions** that reward projects for verifiable on-chain impact, such as driving liquidity, integrations, or usage.

By redirecting incentives to builders rather than extractors, Spinach makes DeFi growth **accountable, transparent, and regenerative**. This improves the overall Ethereum UX by: 
•Reducing liquidity churn and deepening long-term pools 
•Giving builders an accessible, data-driven path to funding 

•Incentivizing interoperability and collaboration between protocols

To date, Spinach **has distributed $25,000+ to 15+ public good projects in the Celo ecosystem**, including those supporting **Glo Dollar, GoodDollar, and Regen**.

### Deliverables

- Develop, create, and launch the first multichain Spinach round, showcasing how on-chain retro funding can scale across ecosystems and chains, helping fund public good projects

- Build a multichain competition page featuring participating Gardens projects and cross-chain activity, including TVL and other analytics. 

- Run a Gardens Pool Spinach competition, distributing $3,000 to projects and builders using Gardens for their communities - driving usage, integrations, and grant pool growth across 2–3 supported chains (e.g. ReFi, GreenPill, GoodDollar and other public good ecosystems adopting Gardens as a grant tool).

- Distribute an additional $3000-$5,000 in rewards to public good projects through traditional Spinach competitions and launch on new chains.

- Publicly verify all results on-chain and on spinach.fi/history, ensuring full transparency and measurable on-chain impact.

- Integrate with Prosperity Pass for future Celo rewards 

- Create Hypercerts for participating projects 


All milestones can be verified via [spinach.fi](http://spinach.fi) , spinach.fi/history and our GitHub: <https://github.com/SpinachFi>

The Gardens round will wrap up by December 9th so the data, payouts and participating projects will all be visible on [spinach.fi](http://spinach.fi) 

### Budget

Amount Requested: $7000 for building/deploying, $3000 for builder incentives - total: $10,000

Engineering: $4000

Design: $1500


Partnerships and integrations/Project Management: $1500

Incentives for builders participating in a Spinach x Gardens Competition: $3000 (this won't go to us but will be distributed to builders using Gardens based on TVL)

### GTM & Adoption Plan

Our early users have been ecosystem-aligned builders and public good projects who already use tools like Gardens, Glo Dollar, Regen, and GoodDollar to fund and coordinate their communities. We’ve worked closely with these ecosystems to run pilot competitions on Celo, and are now expanding to Arbitrum and Stellar, targeting DAOs, protocols, and token projects seeking more transparent and impact-based funding. We will do the same thing with projects using Gardens. 

Onboarding to a competition is still manual, we work one-on-one with each community/project/builder to ensure a smooth experience. We reach out to qualifying projects directly, explain the round, and show them how to qualify for additional funding. We also connect with new projects across ecosystems to introduce how Spinach works and how they can earn retro funding in upcoming competitions. This is what drives the most growth. 


We charge a small % of retro funding fees to build in a path to sustainability.
