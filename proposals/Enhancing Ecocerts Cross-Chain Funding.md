## Welcome To The Growth Pool Proposal Form

This form gathers the key details of your proposal to be shared to the community and provide the evaluation council key information to evaluate your proposal.

**Who's this Pool for?**

- Experienced builders with an idea addressing a critical infrastructure need

- Builders of existing public good tooling looking to become more interoperable

**Here are the step you will take:**

1. **Fill Out From** - Provide a detailed yet concise overview of your proposal.

2. **Community Feedback** - Address feedback and questions from the community and evaluators.

3. **Gardens Submission** - Once feedback is addressed, publish proposal on Gardens platform with the funding amount, title, problem being solved and Charmverse proposal link.

Once submitted to Gardens, the Evaluation Council will review your proposal and then support proposals on Gardens. You'll be able to see evaluation feedback on Charmverse and conviction growing on Gardens.

> _As your application moves through the evaluation flow you will receive notifications sent to your email used with Charmverse._

Impact Measurement

### Problem Being Solved

At GainForest, we are actively improving our app, Ecocertain, which is a marketplace for Ecocerts. Ecocerts are digital certificates (hypercerts) that represent verified environmental impact by local communities. The platform connects two key actors: Nature Stewards (Ecocert creators) and Buyers/Donors. We are addressing distinct Ethereum UX challenges for each side:

**For Nature Stewards**

Many stewards operate in remote regions with limited tech experience and struggle with blockchain terminology that seems simple to developers but is confusing to them. Currently, our Ecocert submission form contains technical jargon and requires external assistance to complete. We're redesigning the submit page to be self-explanatory with plain language, visual guides, and contextual help—enabling stewards to mint Ecocerts independently.

**For Buyers/Donors**

Ecocertain operates on Celo because the hypercerts protocol currently supports the Celo blockchain, but potential buyers hold funds on other EVM chains like Ethereum, Base, or Arbitrum. Currently, buyers must manually bridge their assets to Celo before purchasing—a multi-step process that creates friction for donors. We're integrating bridge/swap functionality directly into Ecocertain, allowing buyers to donate from any chain for conversion to Celo, removing this critical barrier to participation.

### Deliverables

- D1: Redesign Ecocertain’s homepage and onboarding flow to a UI that intuitively guides Nature Stewards to create Ecocerts and Donors to fund impact, verified through public demo → Accepted when deployed on mainnet with public demo, supported by analytics dashboard showing measurable improvement in completion rates.

- D2: Integrate bridge/swap functionality into the Ecocertain app, enabling Donors to swap funds from any EVM chain to Celo directly within the purchase flow without using external swapping applications → Accepted when deployed on mainnet and verified through block explorer showing successful cross-chain transactions, with integration documentation published on GitHub.

### GTM & Adoption Plan

**Initial Users/Integrators**

- _Nature Stewards_: Local communities and conservation groups in remote regions who manage and protect natural ecosystems. These users typically have limited blockchain experience and operate in low-connectivity environments. They create Ecocerts to receive funding for their verified environmental impact work.

- _Buyers/Donors_: Impact-focused individuals, organizations, and foundations seeking transparent and verifiable ways to fund conservation projects. This includes crypto-native community members, corporate partners pursuing ESG goals, and climate-focused Web3 communities looking for credible environmental impact investments.

**Promotion & Onboarding Strategy** 

- _Community engagement_: Present at crypto/web3 conferences and public goods events, e.g., Devconnect in Buenos Aires 

- _Hands-on training_: Conduct onboarding and create tutorials to guide users through the new streamlined interface 

- _Multi-channel support_: Provide support via WhatsApp, Telegram, and email 

- _Content marketing_: Share impact stories and success cases demonstrating the value of verified environmental impact 

- _Partnership integrations_: Integrate with existing Web3 platforms and conservation networks to expand reach

**Post-Round Sustainability Strategy** 

- _Revenue Model_: The marketplace functionality enables us to charge a small percentage fee (2.5%) on ecocert transactions as platform sustainability fees to continue operating and improving features. These fees ensure we can maintain the infrastructure, provide ongoing support, and continuously enhance the platform based on user feedback. Transaction fees will be implemented following the release of Ecocertain v2 at the end of March 2026.

**Growth & Sustainability**

- _Network Effects_: As more projects achieve certification and more buyers participate, the marketplace becomes increasingly valuable to all participants. The multiple payment options (crypto and fiat) dramatically expand our addressable market, particularly in emerging economies where traditional certification is cost-prohibitive. 

- _Reduced Customer Acquisition Costs_: The improved user experience and analytics dashboard enable data-driven optimization of conversion funnels, reducing customer acquisition costs while increasing conversion rates. User research insights help us build features that users actually want, increasing organic growth and word-of-mouth referrals. 

- _Institutional Credibility_: The quality framework and partnership validation create trust with traditional environmental organizations, enabling us to capture institutional buyers willing to pay premium prices for verified impact. This shifts our revenue mix toward higher-value customers with larger transaction volumes. 

- _Long-term Projection_: Based on demonstrated traction and network effects, we project the platform will achieve operational sustainability (revenue covering operational costs) within 18-24 months post-grant completion, with marketplace volume growing to $100,000+ as institutional buyers and repeat customers validate the model.
