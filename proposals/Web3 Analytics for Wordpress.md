### Problem Being Solved

## What is the problem that Pipe solves?

Creators and content publishers often struggle to be compensated fairly and transparently for the value they produce, relying on ads, sponsorships, or platforms that take large cuts. This limits the potential of creators to earn sustainably from their work.

Pipe, an open-source WordPress plugin and dashboard previously supported by a $83,000 USD investment from the Interledger Foundation, addresses this challenge by providing:

**Fair and transparent monetization**: Users can install the plugin and start receiving payments via XRP using the Interledger Protocol (ILP), with full visibility of income in the dashboard.

**Direct support from the community**: Pipe empowers creators to capture the full value of their work, without intermediaries reducing their earnings.

**Educational and community support**: Pipe not only enables fair payments, but also educates creators about Web3, helping them understand how blockchain, wallets, and tokens work. Through interactive sessions, community meetings, and posts on Instagram, we guide creators step-by-step, lowering the barriers to adoption and empowering them to confidently participate in the decentralized economy.

## 
Next Step – Web3 Expansion:

Pipe already integrates with the Interledger protocol, bridging traditional and decentralized payments through XRP-based settlement. Our next step is to expand into the Ethereum ecosystem via Optimism, connecting the Interledger network to Web3-native value flows.

This expansion focuses on two core advancements:

**Streaming Payments Infrastructure (Powered by Superfluid)**

Pipe will integrate Superfluid’s real-time finance protocol to enable continuous token flows between users and creators — e.g., $0.01 USDC per minute from a supporter. This brings the original Web Monetization vision to life on-chain, allowing money to move as easily as data. Payments become instant, transparent, and composable, setting the foundation for frictionless Web3 monetization.

**Creator Subscriptions on Optimism**

Built on top of the streaming layer, Pipe will introduce on-chain subscriptions where supporters can directly subscribe to creators using tokens like USDC, ETH, or OP. All payments will be streamed in real-time through Superfluid and visualized in the Pipe Dashboard, creating a transparent, engaging, and fair relationship between creators and their audiences.

Open Web3 Standards – Pipe aligns with Web3 interoperability standards such as EAS attestations and future integration with Superfluid streaming payments, ensuring compatibility with broader public goods infrastructure.

Community Engagement & Education – Ongoing partnerships through educational posts, Instagram sessions, and workshops to onboard creators to Web3 payments and decentralized finance principles.

### Deliverables

**D1: Superfluid Integration (Backend Prototype) Implement continuous streaming payments via Superfluid, enabling creators to receive real-time token flows (e.g., USDC, ETH, OP) directly on-chain.** 

✅ Accepted when creators can receive live streams on testnet through the Pipe backend, verified via contract logs.

**D2: Creator Subscription Dashboard (UI Integration) Extend the Pipe Dashboard to visualize real-time payments from subscribers, showing active streams, current balance, and flow rates per subscriber.** 

✅ Accepted when UI elements are live on testnet and stream data is visible in real time.

**D3: On-Chain Subscription Management Enable users to start, pause, and cancel subscriptions through an on-chain interface connected to Superfluid.** 

✅ Accepted when subscription management works fully on testnet and verified via user demo.

**D4: Open Documentation & Tutorial Publish open-source documentation, integration guides, and a “How to Monetize with Superfluid + Pipe” tutorial for creators and developers.** 

✅ Accepted when live on GitHub and Pipe’s community channels (LinkedIn, and Instagram).

### GTM & Adoption Plan

Our initial users are content creators, educators, journalists, and independent publishers who already rely on WordPress to monetize their work. Many of them participated in our first phase with the Interledger Foundation, including university professors and independent media outlets who helped test and refine the early version of Pipe.

To drive adoption, we’ll launch a “Web3 Streaming Monetization Beta” with our existing community — offering guided onboarding sessions and tutorials that introduce creators to wallet-based subscriptions and real-time payments via Superfluid.

Our adoption strategy includes:

- Publishing Quickstart documentation and demo videos showing how to connect a wallet (e.g., MetaMask) and start receiving real-time payments in crypto.

- Running educational webinars for creators, featuring case studies on earning sustainable income using tokens like USDC, OP, or ETH through streaming subscriptions.

- Leveraging social media (Instagram, X, and LinkedIn) to highlight creator success stories and demonstrate how Web3 monetization can be accessible and transparent.

- Partnering with universities, creator collectives, and media labs to test usability, gather feedback, and co-create the next iteration of the experience.

After the grant period, we’ll maintain growth through community-led education, open-source contributions, and integrations with partner ecosystems (e.g., Interledger and Optimism). This ensures long-term sustainability while keeping the mission aligned with public goods principles.
