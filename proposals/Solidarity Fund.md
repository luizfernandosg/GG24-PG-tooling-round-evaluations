## Welcome To The Growth Pool Proposal Form

This form gathers the key details of your proposal to be shared to the community and provide the evaluation council key information to evaluate your proposal.

**Who's this Pool for?**

- Experienced builders with an idea addressing a critical infrastructure need

- Builders of existing public good tooling looking to become more interoperable

**Here are the step you will take:**

1. **Fill Out From** - Provide a detailed yet concise overview of your proposal.

2. **Community Feedback** - Address feedback and questions from the community and evaluators.

3. **Gardens Submission** - Once feedback is addressed, publish proposal on Gardens platform with the funding amount, title, problem being solved and Charmverse proposal link.

Once submitted to Gardens, the Evaluation Council will review your proposal and then support proposals on Gardens. You'll be able to see evaluation feedback on Charmverse and conviction growing on Gardens.

> _As your application moves through the evaluation flow you will receive notifications sent to your email used with Charmverse._

### What categories of public goods does your proposal address?

Impact Measurement, Capital Allocation, Capital Formation

### Problem Being Solved

The Solidarity Fund addresses the capital allocation and impact measurement challenge for public goods by creating a model for non-extractive and sustainable funding that is embedded with participatory, democratic principles and web3-powered flexibility. We replace speculative, one-off donations with a post-capitalist endowment model. Users deposit capital (xDAI), that generates yield (sDAI). This yield is then distributed to member projects and allocated through a voting process that is governed through the Bread token that is created when users make deposits making Bread equal to $1.The Solidarity Fund is a prime example of a concept we call “solidarity primitives” which are foundational socio-technical tools that communities can use to allocate funding and enact public good. This tool creates a sustainable, participatory, and non-speculative UX for both funding public goods and governing a common treasury. We are solving the UX of collective funding and participatory budgeting on-chain and currently have $444k+ of Bread being used to generate yield for 6 member projects including Gardens.

### Github Repo or Organization (If Multiple Repos)

https://github.com/BreadchainCoop/crowdstaking-v2

### Project Tech Stack

Core: Solidity (Foundry), Next.js, React, TypeScript Chain: Gnosis Chain (utilizing xDAI and sDAI from Spark), fund distribution Interoperability Primitives: Dune Analytics: Used to present our analytics and circulating supply Gnosis Safe: The member treasuries that receive the yield disbursements are all Gnosis Safes. KarmaGap: We have started making use of KarmaGap but full integration is still needed Gardens: For fund management of distributed yield from the Solidarity Fund

### Collaborations

Our model is founded on collaborations and partnerships. The Solidarity Fund currently consists of 6 project members namely, Symbiota, Crypto Commons Association, Citizen Wallet, Regen Coordination, Gardens, and the Bread Coop Core. We have just started our cooperation with Gardens and we have a long standing cooperation with Gnosis and are continuously deepening our relationships with them.

### Deliverables

D1: Deepen KarmaGap integration in order to make member projects impact become more visible → Accepted when users of the Solidarity Fund can view KarmaGap endorsements of member projects and create new endorsements directly from the Solidarity Fund, with those endorsements displayed in the interface. By embedding KarmaGap into our application, we will increase transparency and improve both capital allocation and voting outcomes. The successful implementation of this will be exemplary for other projects that want to actively integrate community-based endorsements as a way of validating real world impact in a digital and decentralized way.

D2 (stretch goal for retro funding): Continue integrating with Gardens by connecting our application to our Gardens community and the pool for Gardens’ distribution. This will provide deeper insight into what our users value most and empower member projects to actively engage with governance and fund management tools.→ Accepted when users are linked to Gardens directly within the Solidarity Fund interface, and member projects can link their own pools.

### Budget

Amount Requested: $7,000

Breakdown

KarmaGap Integration — $7,000

Engineering: $4,000

Design: $2,000

Project Management: $1,000

Gardens Fund Integration — (retro)

 

Risks and Mitigations 

KarmaGap API instability → Coordinate directly with KarmaGap devs; rely on on-chain endorsement data as a stable integration source.

### GTM & Adoption Plan

Initial Users/ Integrators

Our initial users/integrators will be our current 6 member projects (Symbiota, CCA, Citizen Wallet, Regen Coordination, Gardens, Bread Coop Core) and our existing $BREAD token holders. These integrations (D1, D2) are direct responses to their feedback for better impact transparency and more dynamic voting.

Promotion and Adoption

All of these integrations will be embedded into our Solidarity Fund application and made available to all of our users in order to make the impact measurement, allocation of capital and voting preferences more efficient. It will take some time to bring all our partner organizations with us but many of them are already making use of KarmaGap to test out their own projects, therefore it will not be an impossible step. We will engage with the KarmaGap team and as a stretch goal the Gardens community of users to show our integration and point to how they can get involved to get more funding.

Successful adoption of these integrations will lead to more transparent and visible impact measurement and visualization thereby increasing the trust that potential public goods investors and new users will have the impactfulness of the Solidarity Fund model. This in turn will attract more participants and communities across the Ethereum ecosystem because the Solidarity Fund will become an even more tried and tested model for community endowment funding and can serve as the infrastructural foundation for many other thematic funds.

The Solidarity Fund model aims to be a solidarity primitive that bridges the crypto and the non-crypto world and unlocks new users, funders and partners that want to make a real impact on the ground. By making sure real life impact (through endorsements) is able to be showcased we can prove to non-crypto impact communities that this is a viable model for disbursing funding.

Post-round sustainability strategy

Our project is inherently designed for sustainability. Our core maintenance and development are funded in part by the Solidarity Fund itself. The "Bread Coop Core" project in the application is for the team that maintains and updates the application. This grant is not for operational overhead; it is to accelerate key interoperability upgrades. These upgrades (KarmaGap, Gardens) make our solidarity primitive more robust and attractive, which in turn attracts more users and capital (grows the TVL), thus growing the total yield and our long-term, self-sustaining development budget.
