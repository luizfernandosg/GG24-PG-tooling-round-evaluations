### What categories of public goods does your proposal address?

Impact Measurement

### Problem Being Solved

At the last UN General Assembly in NYC the Broadband Commission reported that about 5/8 billion people have been connected online.

Most people have been connected online with always-online privacy destroying pocket-wizards **and no training** in the data collection purpose of technology**.**

Society is missing a modern internet onboarding experience that can help teach people how to use new and better technologies.

To transcend the academic philosophy of [openlittermap.com](http://openlittermap.com) and create a more compelling narrative **LitterWeek** is emerging as a new campaign to engage people in producing data to unlock in-world educational experiences in technology + the environment.

Unlike most "weeks" that expect everyone to turn up and participate at the same time and location, LitterWeek can be started and repeated at any time.

We already produce automated impact reports at [x.com/OLM_bot](https://x.com/OLM_bot)

Thanks to Gitcoin funding in GG22 + GG23 OpenLitterMap is currently going through a major [AI-supercharged refactor](http://github.com/OpenLitterMap/openlittermap-web/pull/668/) which, _wen??_ you ask, is expected to merge in 2026.

We also need to start working on the OpenLitterAI, and review, test & launch [Littercoin.eth](https://github.com/OpenLitterMap/littercoin-eth) - something most participants have no idea they are passively mining in the background.

By supporting this proposal you will help turbocharge the development of our technology and get our first LitterWeek pilots up & running.

If you would like to read more about my proposal:

On the 16th of October 2025 I sent my 2nd report about my work to the Irish government Oireachtas committee on Education, Research, Innovation & Science 

**[From Data to Direction: Fixing Broken Systems with Citizen Science ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1moy5pzu-IqNODH9F-CrxJPgb0w5MSsbp/view)_[#WenFix](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1moy5pzu-IqNODH9F-CrxJPgb0w5MSsbp/view)_** is now available with an executive summary on the last page.

This would be a great time to accelerate the development of OpenLitterMap and continue to display the leadership and commitment of Gitcoin to transcend the limitations imposed by the ww2 era systems of the past.

In \~2020 OpenLitterMap was recognised to be a Digital Public Good by the UN endorsed Digital Public Goods Alliance.

### Deliverables

1. Launch OLMv5 

   https://github.com/OpenLitterMap/openlittermap-web/pull/668
   - this is an ongoing major AI-transformation of OpenLitterMap.

 
2. Then build LitterWeek MVP and get first users

3. We will revisit the Littercoin smart contract, get it audited, and run some testnet experiments. Some help here from Eth community would be great

### Budget

My pre-seed target to bring LitterWeek to market is $420,069.

So far we have raised \~$20,000 from Cardano and $5,000 from Gitcoin.

So far I have spent over €100,000 directly plus years of unpaid constant sacrifice.

I would like to raise $10,000 from Gitcoin for the first time to support the development of my work. With enough funding I would like to hire another developer or 2 and then bring someone for community + socials (needed) and another strategy + sales person on board who I have in mind.

Co-founders welcome! I expect to see more people + specific roles listed here in the future.

### GTM & Adoption Plan

Over 8750 people have organically signed up to openlittermap with no marketing or advertising.

With OLMv5 we will create a new email + marketing campaign to invite them to participate in the LitterWeek campaign.

There are 100,000s of small volunteer cleanup organisations around the world.

OpenLitterMap is too academic but once LitterWeek is ready we will have a much more compelling message to onboard them, and reach out to other orgs that can benefit from cost-effective community-first marketing.
