## Welcome To The Growth Pool Proposal Form

This form gathers the key details of your proposal to be shared to the community and provide the evaluation council key information to evaluate your proposal.

**Who's this Pool for?**

- Experienced builders with an idea addressing a critical infrastructure need

- Builders of existing public good tooling looking to become more interoperable

**Here are the step you will take:**

1. **Fill Out From** - Provide a detailed yet concise overview of your proposal.

2. **Community Feedback** - Address feedback and questions from the community and evaluators.

3. **Gardens Submission** - Once feedback is addressed, publish proposal on Gardens platform with the funding amount, title, problem being solved and Charmverse proposal link.

Once submitted to Gardens, the Evaluation Council will review your proposal and then support proposals on Gardens. You'll be able to see evaluation feedback on Charmverse and conviction growing on Gardens.

### What categories of public goods does your proposal address?

Impact Measurement, Identity/Reputation, Governance/Coordination, Capital Allocation

### Problem Being Solved

**Core Pain Point: Governance Overhead in DAO Treasury Management** 

**Current DAO treasury distribution requires:**

- Grant committees meeting weekly to approve allocations 30-50% of organizational capacity spent on approval processes 

- Weeks of delay between contributor work and payment 

- Power imbalances between givers and receivers

**Free-Association's Solution: A computational protocol for mutual self-actualization that** 

**eliminates manual approval through recognition-weighted Superfluid streams. DAOs computationally distribute treasury funds based on member recognition patterns rather than committee votes:**

- **[Collective Recognition Allocation:](https://playnet.gitbook.io/docs/collective-recognition)** Resources flow automatically from provider capacities to declared needs based on recognition patterns 

**Measurable Impact:**

- **Reduces allocation decision time from weeks → seconds (computational)**

- **Eliminates 99% of committee/approval overhead**

- **Enables continuous, merit-based compensation**

- **Scales elegantly: 10 → 1,000+ participants with same per-person complexity**

### Team

**[Playnet](https://playnet.lol) - a  network of activists, artists, coders, and researchers building open-source tools, frameworks, and economies for equitable resource distribution**

We experiment with models that redistribute power and resources through mutual aid, trust, and collective creativity. 

Over the past three years, we’ve engaged hundreds of people globally through “play-labs” and grown to a community of 50 active contributors based around the world. 

Play-labs are effectively games where communities design and test systems for self-organized surplus distribution.

**Key Experience:**

- Developed **[complete organizational protocol](https://playnet.gitbook.io/docs/organizations/protocol)** eliminating governance overhead

- Deployed functional browser-based Free-Association interface at interplaynetary.github.io/free-association 

**Advisors/Contributors:**

- Community testing in real-world resource allocation scenarios 

- Organizations experimenting with recognition-based coordination


**We don't organize via roles, we organize with free-association**

**Some key playnet://free-association development contributors:**

### Deliverables

## **Deliverables**

### **D1:** Recognition-Weighted Resource Allocation Interface

**What We're Building:** 

A production web interface where organizations computationally allocate resources based on mutual recognition patterns, with integrated compliance filtering.

### **Core Components:**

**Recognition Interface**

- Members distribute 100% recognition across contributors 

- Real-time sync via Holster protocol 

**Need Declaration & Provider Capacity System**

- Slot-based interface for members to declare needs 

- Providers declare available resources

- Automatic allocation engine matches capacities to needs

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Live production deployment at custom domain

- ≥15 participants from 2+ organizations testing over 4 weeks

- MRD computation runs weekly with automated membership status updates

- At least 3 provider capacity declarations with successful automatic allocations

- KYC verification functional with compliance filters applied to all allocations

- Almost Zero manual approval processes (98% computational allocation)

**Verification:**

- Production URL with working demo and test accounts

- GitHub release with >80% test coverage

- Video walkthrough demonstrating complete flow: recognition → MRD → needs → capacity → automatic allocation

- Published case study from pilot organization showing governance overhead elimination

---

## **D2: Superfluid Streaming Integration**

**What We're Building:** Enable continuous, recognition-weighted resource flows through Superfluid streams, plus Safe module for DAO treasury management.

### **Core Components:**

**Superfluid Stream Manager**

- Converts recognition weights → stream flow rates 

- Automatic stream adjustments when recognition changes 

- Integration with D1 recognition data

**Safe Module for DAO Treasuries**

- Zodiac-compatible module for Gnosis Safe 

- Enables DAOs to manage Superfluid streams from treasury Automated stream creation/updates based on recognition patterns

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Superfluid streams flowing based on collective recognition on mainnet (Optimism or Polygon)

- ≥5 organizational using module for fund distribution

**Verification:**

- Live Superfluid streams visible at app.superfluid.finance with recognition-weighted rates

### Budget

**Amount Requested: $10,000** 

- Core Development - $5000

- UI/UX completion and refinement - $2,500

- Infrastructure & Operations - $1,500

- Secure Federated Server infrastructure costs - $1000 

- Testing and security audits - $1000

- Housing/food support for core contributors during development sprint Enables full-time focus on deliverables completion
