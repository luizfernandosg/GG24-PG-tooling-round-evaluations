### What categories of public goods does your proposal address?

Impact Measurement

### Problem Being Solved

Ethereum UX Challenge: The biggest UX barrier to scaling Ethereum for public goods is onboarding non-technical users - especially those working on-the-ground in communities where regenerative action is happening.


Bloom Network’s Local Action Rewards protocol bridges this gap by integrating Privy Wallets and Inverter Network’s bounty contracts directly into a social coordination platform. It allows community organizers to document real-world regenerative actions (like watershed restoration or entrepreneurship education) and automatically receive on-chain recognition and funding - no crypto literacy required.


We make Ethereum funding UX human, translating smart contracts and attestations into a simple user flow:

- Action documented → verified by peers →

- FLO (Flowers) reputation tokens issued to individuals and their local treasury →

- Impact automatically posted to each project's Karma GAP →

- Retro funding distributed via Optimism, Arbitrum, or Base with <$0.10 gas, proportional to FLO earned that quarter.

Measurable Problem Solved:

- 300+ new Ethereum wallets onboarded using guided workflows

- 35,000+ hours of verified commons care labor rewarded

- Transaction fees reduced from \~$1,000 (fiat) → $4 (L2)

- 723,840 FLO tokens issued as transparent impact attestations

We’re building a user interface and economic layer that turns Ethereum’s funding tools into everyday public goods UX.

### Karma GAP Profile

https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/bloom-network - on-chain metrics. https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/bloom-international/funding/new - impact reports from the global infrastructure team
Each Local Bloom node has its own Karma GAP - we still need to put them into a community on Karma like how ReFi DAO is set up. Example: https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/bloom-international/updates

Our integration with Karma GAP outputs impact reports to the "Updates" section on Karma.

### Github Repo or Organization (If Multiple Repos)

https://github.com/BloomNetwork

### Project Tech Stack

- SvelteKit (frontend framework)

- Supabase (backend for the CMS)

- Privy Wallet (embedded onboarding & identity)

- Inverter Network Bounty Contracts (impact funding logic)

- Karma GAP (integration for impact publishing & reporting)

- Gnosis Safe (community treasury ops)

Interoperability primitives: Karma GAP + Inverter contracts + Web2 impact reporting interface with full storytelling capability = transparent retroactive funding UX.

### Collaborations

Confirmed:
\- Inverter Network - bounty smart contract architecture on Optimism - we also helped develop and test their bounty app
\- Karma GAP - automated impact reporting integration
\- Privy - embedded wallet onboarding for non-crypto users
\- Giveth - round funder (one of the Local Bloom nodes helped develop Giveth)
\- Regen Coordination
\- Kinship Earth - regenerative economy donor network
\- Farmers Land Trust - crowdfunding and legal templates for community farmland trusts
\- NeXtState
\- Para - wallet integration, we give them feedback on low technical capacity users who have old devices and other field work problems

Planned:
\- Silvi - impact interoperability to reduce reporting burden for agroforestry projects and enhance Local Bloom nodes' data capabilities
\- Giveth - co-integration partner for impact reporting / project updates
\- Allo Protocol via Ethereum Localism - local funding rounds
\- Regen Coordination - Bloom as coordination council member

### Deliverables

- D1: Deliver and demo Bloom Onboarding Campaign & Training Series → Run a one-month onboarding drive using Bloom’s integrated Privy Wallet and Inverter tools to onboard 100 new users and 3 new local hubs to Ethereum public goods funding. → Verification: On-chain FLO bounty claims for onboarding completion, demo of live training sessions, and attestation from Bloom community confirming active hubs.

- D2: Publish Ethereum Public Goods Education Series → Publish 3 educational articles and 1 live webinar showing how Bloom and other protocols make Ethereum public goods accessible through real-world community use cases. Accepted when content and engagement metrics are verified by public attestation.

### Budget

- Amount Requested: $12,000

  - Education & Content Creation – $4,000 Produce 3 educational articles and 1 live webinar explaining Ethereum public goods and Bloom’s real-world community use cases. Includes research, writing, editing, design, hosting, and team time.

  - Onboarding Campaign & Training – $6,500 Run 3 live onboarding trainings and support 3 new local Bloom hubs. Integrate FLO bounties as an on-chain verification mechanism for 100 new users completing onboarding via Bloom’s system. Covers team coordination, outreach, and operational support.

  - Project Management & Coordination – $1,500 Schedule and organize trainings, verify milestone completion, track metrics, and ensure deliverables are completed and reported by Dec 9.

- Risks & Mitigations:

  - Low onboarding participation → fallback: schedule additional trainings and leverage partner networks for outreach.

  - Content delivery delays → fallback: pre-record webinars, stagger article releases, and use attestation for verification.

  - FLO bounty claim issues → fallback: supplement with attested participation logs verified by Bloom team leads and attendees. Our bounty claims system has been working smoothly for a year.

### GTM & Adoption Plan

Initial Users / Integrators: 3-5 new local Bloom hubs plus at least 100 new Ethereum users participating in the onboarding campaign.

Adoption Strategy:

- Run 3 live onboarding trainings using Bloom’s integrated Privy + Inverter tools.

- Award FLO bounties as on-chain verification for onboarding completion.

- Publish 3 educational articles and 1 webinar showcasing real-world Ethereum public goods use cases, designed to be accessible to other public goods projects, DAOs, and ecosystem participants, and to attract traditional funders to all.

- Promote through Bloom’s existing network, partner platforms (Karma GAP, Inverter Network, Giveth), other Ethereum public goods communities, traditional philanthropic foundations, and social channels.

Post-Round Sustainability:

- Maintain momentum by integrating newly onboarded users into quarterly Local Action Rewards cycles.

- Capture lessons and engagement metrics to guide future scaling campaigns 

 and continued ecosystem adoption.
