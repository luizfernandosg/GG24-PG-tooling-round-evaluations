To drive adoption:

- Launch a closed beta of the Hey mobile app for verified Lens creators.

- Publish a Quickstart guide + SDK docs for developers building Lens-integrated tools.

- Run community campaigns via Lens, Farcaster, and Zora to onboard new users through social quests and attestations.

- Post-round, sustainability comes from Hey Pro subscriptions and ecosystem collaborations—funding continued open-source maintenance and SDK improvements.
