### What categories of public goods does your proposal address?

Capital Allocation, Governance/Coordination

### Problem Being Solved

Giveth is an open-source, Web3-native crowdfunding platform founded in 2016. It is one of the most popular public good funding platforms in Ethereum and crypto as a whole. We’ve been steadily expanding and experimenting with new public good legos like quadratic funding, the GIV economy, GIVbacks to make giving rewarding, GIVpower for community curation and AI donor agents.

We’re tackling a few core Ethereum UX challenges: public good funding, capital allocation and governance by allowing large communities to allocate funds for public goods in a decentralized way.

Here is a quick explanation of our unique traits and products:

\* Global, Zero-Fee Crowdfunding Donations: Every donation goes directly to the project’s, no hidden fees, no intermediaries. Donors in any country can support impact projects instantly.


\* GIVbacks Raffle Program: Every donation of $5 or more gives donors a chance to win up to 500,000 $GIV, turning generosity into an exciting, gamified experience. (https://docs.giveth.io/givbacks) 

\* The GIVeconomy: A full regenerative token economy where $GIV powers governance, staking, rewards, and impact multipliers across the ecosystem. (https://docs.giveth.io/giveconomy) 

\* GIVpower: GIV holders can stake and lock GIV to get GIVpower a non-transferable token used to help projects be more visible on the platform.

\* Giveth Causes: Thematic donation pools (e.g., climate, education, humanitarian aid) that let donors back a cause and automatically distribute funding across multiple vetted projects through an impact measurement AI agent.

\* Quadratic Funding: Funding rounds with a matching pool used to incentivize community donations and community curation to allocate capital within a specific domain.


KPIs:

\* 7.2K+ Projects
\* 25K+ Donors
\* 436K+ total donations
\* 5 M+ USD in total donations
\* 11 Blockchains supported
\* 15 Quadratic Funding rounds hosted

Giveth has been a trusted actor in Web3 since 2016, born out of the recovery efforts from TheDAO hack. Our founders and community played a central role in safeguarding the Ethereum ecosystem during its most critical crises, cementing Giveth as a values-driven, resilient, and battle-tested organization. However, our reach is constrained by our own communication channels: our website, socials, blog posts, and word-of-mouth from project owners. This caps our ability to pull donations from fresh audiences and grow for the benefit of the public goods and projects on the platform.  

Our Base Mini App will simplify the donation experience in QF rounds and will become a seamless, mobile-first gateway launching on the Base App and Farcaster. It works in tandem with our tech stack and QF rounds to funnel more capital into Giveth projects and public goods, while tackling onboarding and donation UX friction in Ethereum.

It will deliver an intuitive UX for Base users to discover, support, and track donations in moments with no friction. It will make donating during our QF rounds as simple as a few clicks while scrolling your Farcaster timeline.

Here are also some success stories:

Success Stories:


\* GIVearth (Environment-Focused QF Round): In Summer 2024, Giveth hosted its first climate-focused Quadratic Funding round on Celo. Nearly 800 unique donors made 3,000+ donations, raising community contributions equal to 120% of the matching pool value. This demonstrated how QF can supercharge donor engagement and amplify impact for environmental projects. 

\* BUIDL on Polygon (Ecosystem-Focused QF Round): Our largest QF round to date distributed $200K to 206 Polygon builders. With 3,200+ unique donors contributing $160K (80% of the pool value), the round highlighted Giveth’s ability to mobilize broad communities and strengthen entire blockchain ecosystems. Palestine Children’s 

\* Relief Fund (PCRF): Raised $350K+ from 1,800+ donors for urgent medical aid.


\* Defend Roman Storm: $320K+ raised for open-source legal defense.


\* Diamante Luz (Costa Rica): $80K+ raised for regenerative communities
.

\* DappNode: $46K+ raised to support decentralized node infrastructure.

### Collaborations

\* Gitcoin: Ongoing partnership; We are serving as Domain Allocators, leveraging our tech stack for Quadratic Funding (QF) rounds and, potentially, other public good initiatives, ww could co-promote the Base Mini App in their next funding cycle to drive cross-platform donor engagement.

\* Superfluid: Active collaboration. Recurring donations on Superfluid have skyrocketed from $407 in January to over $10,000 by September, a 2,362% surge in 9 months, unlocking a powerful stream of sustained funding for Giveth projects (Read more here: https://forum.superfluid.org/t/season-4-ideas-giveth/1257). We aim to integrate their Supertokens, live on Base, into the Mini App for recurring donations

\* Past sponsors of QF rounds: Blockchain and crypto projects like Octant, ENS, Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism, Metapool, Celo, Glo Dollar and many others have funded over 700K in matching pool funding. We expect to continue raising funds for public goods and domain-specific rounds.

\* Human Passport: We integrated Human Passport as one of the measures to protect QF rounds from Sybil attacks.

\* KarmaGAP: Planned integration discussions underway to embed DeVouch verification into their gap-funding model, enabling seamless credential-based donations.

\* Squid router: We integrate Squid Router into the donation flow on Giveth Causes for the AI donor agent to distribute funds.

### Deliverables

D1: Deploy The Giveth Base Mini App → Accepted when the app is deployed and live on the Base App.

D2: Paymaster, batched txs and recurring donations enabled → Accepted when the live version has these features live on the Giveth Base Mini App.

### Budget

- Amount Requested: $10,900 

  - Front End: $7,900 - Sign In changes, add conditional logic for base app user and for submitting donation through minikit SDK, integrate Paymaster functions. 

  - Back End: $4,500 - BE SIWE with Mini kit auth and Donation Verification from base app donation. 

  - Project Management & Ops: $3,500 - PM Planning & Execution. 

  - QA: $1,500 - Testing and documentation.



Note: $6,500 has been deducted to make the request more feasible, with plans to pursue retroactive funding for the difference.

### GTM & Adoption Plan

We are targeting Base App users, donors and project owners active on Farcaster. Our goal is to help give and fundraise with no friction. 

For the launch, we’re leaning into the holiday spirit with a “Give on Base” campaign, timed for November and December giving season. As well as, other activations. We will also coordinate with our partners to amplify the launch, including: Base, Superfluid, Gardens, Public Nouns, Glo Dollar, etc.


Today, Giveth’s main sustainability drivers are: 
- Grants to integrate new blockchains and tech to Giveth 
- Quadratic Funding hosting: Partner ecosystems pay to run QF rounds. 
- Donations: Direct and add on donations directly to Giveth. 
- Emerging revenue from Causes: Fees on allocations and launch deposits to Giveth Causes and it's AI donation agent. 

While the revenue is not yet covering the operating costs most months :-/ Giveth financial performance has improved significantly, leading to profit in several months this year. We are a capital Domain allocator in GG24, and we are working on a few major collaborations that are still in stealth mode and will likely be announced in the coming weeks/months. 

Our multiple sources of revenue give us resilience. We have been here nearly 10 years and hope to make it at least 10 more.
