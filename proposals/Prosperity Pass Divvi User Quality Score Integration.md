### Problem Being Solved

The pseudonymous nature of blockchain networks makes it challenging to identify and empower key contributors, leading to most programs prioritizing low-value contributions, such as simple app clicks, over long-term, high-value contributions that drive real value and development.

Prosperity Pass, and other deployments of the open-source Eco Accounts stack, create rich user profiles that provide 1) A way for users to explore and contribute meaningfully to ecosystems, and 2) allow projects and programs to prioritize high-value users, resulting in more aligned and valuable networks.

Through this specific development and integration, we will collaborate with [Divvi](https://divvi.xyz/) to integrate the Prosperity Pass and, later, Super Accounts levels into the Proof of Impact campaign, which rewards applications for driving onchain activity. By leveraging the Account Levels, we will generate a User Quality Score, which labels onchain transactions to the account levels of the associated wallets.

The impact of the user quality score will significantly improve the efficiency of onchain growth programs in line with Regenerative practices, functioning as: 

1. An incentive to promote wider Celo dApp usage, by increasing the rewards an Application can earn if its users are also using additional CELO dApps, leading to an incentive to integrate and provide user journeys beyond a single application.

2. A sign of quality, having power users function as a signal for an emerging app's quality, creating the incentive for early projects to target, reach out to, and collaborate with power users to shape meaningful applications.


Once integrated into Prosperity Pass, we will also implement the same changes for Super Accounts as part of this proposal and update / open-source these new features into the Eco Accounts Stack.

### Collaborations

Active partnerships with Celo through CeloPG and Optimism through Superchain Eco. Planned integration with Divvi and Talent. 

### Deliverables

**D1: Finalize Prosperity Pass Account API** -> Initial market-ready Prosperity Pass API launched and documents shared, allowing third-party PG apps to leverage Prosperity Pass (and Super Accounts) data.

**D2: Complete Divvi User Quality Score Integration** -> Successful MVP of Divvi User Quality Score of both Prosperity Pass and Super Accounts. 

### Budget

Amount Requested: $11,000

Design - $1,000 

Testing - $1,000 

Engineering - $6,000 

Project Management - $3.000

We mitigate risks by working closely with the Divvi team and having regular stand-ups and check-ins with the team and partners.

### GTM & Adoption Plan

- The initial integrator will be Divvi, powering the Proof of Impact program of CeloPG, which is a program with a remaining budget of over $100K in CELO and OP tokens.

- We'll leverage the existing CeloPG (1,6K) and Superchain Eco (15.9K) to promote the new functions and target the 3.5K Prosperity Pass and 125K Super Accounts users.

- The User Quality Score should showcase that leveraging rich user data creates better ecosystem growth programs, allowing for a strong 2026 proposal to Celo and Optimism to cover the next phase of innovation and development.
