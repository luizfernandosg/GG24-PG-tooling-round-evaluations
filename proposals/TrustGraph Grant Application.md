### What categories of public goods does your proposal address?

Identity/Reputation, Governance/Coordination, Capital Allocation

### Problem Being Solved

Most DAOs and public goods communities on Ethereum struggle with **legitimacy, participation, and sybil resistance** because governance systems rely on tokens or wallets — not trust. Token-weighted voting skews power toward capital, while pseudonymous participation makes it hard to measure real reputation or contribution. This results in **poor UX for governance**, where genuine contributors lack clear recognition, and communities cannot easily **see, measure, or leverage social trust** in decision-making.

TrustGraph addresses this **core identity and governance UX gap** by making **social trust verifiable, visible, and portable** across the Ethereum ecosystem. Through attestations (digital vouches) and calculated TrustScores, DAOs and public goods tools can integrate **trust-weighted permissions** — such as voting rights, proposal submission, or evaluator access — enabling a smoother, fairer, and more human governance experience.

TrustGraph is designed as a **bidirectionally composable primitive** for the Ethereum public goods ecosystem. Our development strategy focuses on two key dimensions of modularity:

### **TrustScores as Outbound Signals**

We are building TrustGraph so that **TrustScores generated via attestations can be consumed as modular components** by other protocols, DAOs, and capital allocation systems. Rather than requiring deep integration or dependency on TrustGraph's full stack, external systems can:

- **Query TrustScores via standardized APIs** and use them as input signals for their own governance, access control, or allocation logic

- **Subscribe to TrustScore updates** through event-based architectures, allowing real-time permission adjustments

- **Compose trust signals with other reputation systems** (token holdings, contribution history, impact metrics) to create hybrid legitimacy models

- **Export attestation graphs** for analysis, visualization, or integration into custom decision-making frameworks

This "trust as a signal" approach positions TrustGraph as **pluggable infrastructure** — DAOs can incorporate trust-weighted logic without rebuilding reputation systems from scratch.

### **Incorporating External Signals as Inbound Inputs**

Equally important, we are designing TrustGraph's **TrustScore calculation engine to be extensible**, capable of incorporating signals from external sources to enrich trust assessments. This includes:

- **Onchain credentials and badges** (e.g., Passport stamps, POAPs, Hypercerts, Hats Protocol roles) as base trust signals

- **Proof of humanity and sybil resistance** primitives (e.g., Human Passport, Proof of Humanity, World ID) to bootstrap network trust

- **Contribution and impact metrics** from platforms like Karma Gap, Dework, Coordinape, or SourceCred

- **Token-gated or stake-based signals** where relevant (e.g., protocol governance token holdings, staked positions)

- **Cross-network attestations** from other EAS-based systems or Web3 reputation protocols

By making TrustScore calculation **modular and configurable**, different TrustGraph networks can weight various input signals according to their context — a developer DAO might emphasize GitHub contributions and code reviews, while a funding allocation network might prioritize impact attestations and Hypercerts.

### **Result: An Interoperable Trust Layer**

This dual modularity creates a **composable trust layer** that can:

- Serve as a **reputation backend** for existing governance tools (Safe, Hats, Gardens, etc.)

- Function as a **signal aggregation engine** that synthesizes multiple data sources into actionable trust metrics

- Enable **cross-protocol reputation portability**, where trust earned in one context (e.g., a funding round) becomes usable in another (e.g., DAO governance)

- Support **experimentation with trust models** — different networks can test different input weightings and thresholds without forking the core infrastructure

This approach directly advances the Round's goal of **increasing interoperability** across public goods tooling. Rather than building another siloed reputation system, we're creating **shared infrastructure** that makes trust legible and actionable across the entire Ethereum ecosystem.

- **ENS:** Used for decentralized identity resolution and human-readable naming.

**Exploring Further Integrations & Collaborations**

We are actively exploring and designing new interoperability pathways to extend TrustGraph’s utility across the Ethereum public goods ecosystem:

- **Gnosis Safe + Zodiac Roles:** Integrated at the contract level to support governance and proposal flow, though currently hidden in the UI pending further iterations.

- **Hats Protocol:** For assigning and managing DAO roles gated by TrustScores.

- **Hypercerts (v0.2):** Connecting impact & contribution proofs to social trust data. TrustGraph attestations linkable to Hypercert claims via EAS schema extensions

- **Karma GAP:** Enhancing impact reporting and funding intelligence by associating Karma project and individual profiles with TrustScores, enabling richer insight into contributor credibility and ecosystem relationships. Karma Gap projects can display TrustScore-backed milestone verification.

**Openness & Standards**

TrustGraph is **open source**, **permissionless**, and built for **modular interoperability**. All data is portable and queryable via **EAS** and **GraphQL APIs**, ensuring transparency and composability across the Ethereum public goods ecosystem.

**Why This Stack Fits Public Goods Tooling**

TrustGraph’s architecture is intentionally modular — combining verifiable off-chain computation, open attestation standards, and interoperable governance primitives. This enables **fast, transparent, and composable** reputation systems that can plug directly into existing DAO infrastructure. The stack prioritizes credibility, interoperability, and usability — the key pillars for next-generation Ethereum public goods tooling.

### Collaborations

With support from this PG Tooling Round, TrustGraph will build out a comprehensive trust-based governance integration layer across multiple critical public goods protocols. Our approach embodies the bidirectional modularity described above: these integrations both expose TrustScores as consumable signals for partner protocols to use in their governance logic, and incorporate signals from partner protocols as inputs into TrustScore calculations.

This creates a composable trust ecosystem where:

\- Outbound: Protocols like Safe, Hats, and Gardens can query TrustScores to gate access, weight votes, or assign roles
\- Inbound: TrustGraph networks will incorporate credentials from Hypercerts, Karma Gap deliverables, Human Passport verification, and token-based contributions as factors in trust assessment

Each integration demonstrates how TrustGraph functions as modular infrastructure — not a monolithic reputation system, but a flexible primitive that can be composed with other public goods tools to create context-appropriate trust models. Our focus is on making TrustScores actionable across the full spectrum of DAO operations — from multi-sig access control to role management, conviction voting, impact measurement, and rewards distribution.

### Deliverables

The following deliverables are **prioritized in order of commitment**. We are **committing to full delivery of D1** within the grant timeline, with D2 as a stretch goal dependent on development velocity, additional funding, and integration partner readiness.

**D1: Gnosis Safe Zodiac Module for Trust-Based Multi-Sig Management**

We will develop and deploy a **Zodiac module for Gnosis Safe** that enables DAOs to dynamically manage signer permissions based on TrustScores from TrustGraph networks. This module will allow communities to scale their multi-sigs beyond static founding teams while maintaining security through verifiable social trust.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Zodiac module **deployed to Ethereum mainnet** (and at least one L2)

- Module enables DAOs to **set trust thresholds** for adding/removing signers automatically

- **Open-source implementation** published to GitHub with comprehensive documentation

- **Demo video** showcasing end-to-end flow: network member reaches trust threshold → automatically becomes Safe signer → threshold changes update permissions

- At least **one pilot DAO** successfully integrates and operates using the module (verified via onchain transactions and attestations)

**Technical Scope:**

- Integration with TrustGraph indexing layer for real-time TrustScore queries

- Frontend components for module configuration within Safe interface

- Testing across multiple Safe configurations and threshold scenarios

**D2: Gardens (Conviction Voting) Integration**

We will build native integration with **Gardens / 1Hive's conviction voting system**, enabling **TrustScore-weighted voting power**. Key features include:

- TrustScore as a conviction rate modifier for token holding or one-person-one-vote

- Minimum TrustScore requirements for proposal submission

- Protection against sybil attacks through attestation-backed identity verification

This integration enables Gardens communities to move beyond token-weighted governance toward trust-weighted decision-making, creating more equitable and context-aware funding mechanisms.

**Development Timeline:**

- **Weeks 1-2**: Gnosis Safe Zodiac Module development

- **Weeks 2-3**: Testing, documentation, pilot deployment

- **Weeks 3-4**: Outreach and onboarding

- **Weeks 5-6:** (Stretch Goal) Further feature development
