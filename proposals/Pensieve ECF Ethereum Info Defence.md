## Welcome To The Growth Pool Proposal Form

This form gathers the key details of your proposal to be shared to the community and provide the evaluation council key information to evaluate your proposal.

**Who's this Pool for?**

- Experienced builders with an idea addressing a critical infrastructure need

- Builders of existing public good tooling looking to become more interoperable

**Here are the step you will take:**

1. **Fill Out From** - Provide a detailed yet concise overview of your proposal.

2. **Community Feedback** - Address feedback and questions from the community and evaluators.

3. **Gardens Submission** - Once feedback is addressed, publish proposal on Gardens platform with the funding amount, title, problem being solved and Charmverse proposal link.

Once submitted to Gardens, the Evaluation Council will review your proposal and then support proposals on Gardens. You'll be able to see evaluation feedback on Charmverse and conviction growing on Gardens.

> _As your application moves through the evaluation flow you will receive notifications sent to your email used with Charmverse._

### What categories of public goods does your proposal address?

Impact Measurement, Governance/Coordination, Capital Allocation

### Problem Being Solved

Ethereum’s coordination layer **lacks a verifiable and community owned knowledge base** for evaluating projects and making informed collective decisions. Today, information about builders, projects, and funding impact is fragmented, unverifiable, and centrally curated, creating information asymmetry, trust gaps, and inefficiencies in how public goods are supported.

Traditional grant and reputation systems rely on institutional judgment or self reported data, offering little transparency or shared context for what is true or credible. Without a decentralized process for fact verification and consensus, collective intelligence in Web3 remains underutilized and vulnerable to misinformation.

ECF Pensieve introduces a **decentralized knowledge coordination mechanism** that serves as an **info defense layer** for Ethereum ecosystem, where information about projects is co-created, validated, and governed by the community itself. Built on Pensieve, the Elderwand Evaluation Engine transforms this verified knowledge into **quantifiable accountability and legitimacy metrics**, allowing funders and communities to **identify trustworthy, transparent, and high impact public goods**.

Together, they address Ethereum’s core UX challenge in **collective sense making**, turning fragmented and unverifiable data into an open, continuously verifiable public knowledge layer for funding decisions.

### Collaborations

KarmaGAP, Aragon OSx, Sablier, Agora

### Deliverables

D1: Iterate Elderwand Evaluation Engine Alpha 

→ Accepted when new evaluation items and metrics (e.g. Participation Rank) is live on pensieve.ecf.network. 
Verification: Updated Participation evaluation logic on GitHub, merged and pushed it to the product that showing metric computation, and data stored on Arweave for transparency.

D2: Integrate Elderwand with KarmaGAP Framework

→ Accepted when Elderwand metrics are mapped to the KarmaGAP accountability dimensions, enabling shared evaluation standards and interoperability.

Verification: Integration documentation and demo published on GitHub, showing compatibility between Elderwand metrics and KarmaGAP reference schema.

### Budget

- Amount Requested: $15,000

  - Research & Design – $6,000 (40%) Define and model new accountability items, refine formulas, and design KarmaGAP mapping logic.

  - Engineering & Development – $7,000 (47%) Implement new metrics, integrate Elderwand with KarmaGAP, and deploy the updated Alpha version on Pensieve.ECF.

  - Verification & Documentation – $2,000 (13%) Testing, Arweave proof, GitHub documentation, and live product showcasing updated evaluation and interoperability.

- Risks & Mitigations:

  - Integration delays → fallback to a local KarmaGAP-compatible test schema if external sync is not yet live.

  - Metric complexity → launch a minimal set of new ranks first, expand after validation and community testing.

### GTM & Adoption Plan

**Initial Users:**

Pensieve.ECF is live in Open Alpha with **100+ web 3 projects** creating community validated pages. It enables community-driven evaluation of projects through the Elderwand Evaluation Engine, which has launched its first tests on **Transparency, Community-Trusted, and Accountability** metrics.

**Adoption approach:** 

Current adoption is led by the **[Perennial Grant Campaign](https://medium.com/ecf-review/official-announcement-perennial-grant-experiment-epoch-1-8383dc15b0dd)**, where Elderwand rankings guide funding toward transparent and accountable public goods. Campaign runs through ECF social media and community channels and collaboration with Sablier.

**Post-Round Sustainability:**

After this iteration, Elderwand will continue evolving as a public good integrated into Pensieve’s info defence layer, maintained through recurring Perennial Grant rounds and collaborations with public grant programs (e.g. Gitcoin, Octant) to further validate and iterate Elderwand accountability metrics. Long term, the evaluation data will inform interoperable ranking APIs and potential third-party integrations, ensuring continuous ecosystem adoption and self-sustaining usage.
