### Problem Being Solved

**Proposal on Gardens Fund** 

👇🏽

<https://app.gardens.fund/gardens/10/0xda10009cbd5d07dd0cecc66161fc93d7c9000da1/0xd95bf6da95c77466674bd1210e77a23492f6eef9/179/0x9b63d37fc5f7a7b497c1a3107a10f6ff9c2232d8-5>

Ultra easy to use DApp for new users—especially in Global South communities—face high friction in discovering, trusting, and funding climate public goods onchain. We focus on consumer application, similar uiux as the most used apps in the world, this to make a sense of familiarization and lower the barrier of usability.

Existing tools are fragmented:

- No mobile-native discovery for non-crypto users (onboarding + UX gap) 

- No user friendly verification to assess real-world impact (trust gap) 

- No unified flow from browsing to donating to tracking (fragmentation gap) 

We solve this by building SwipePad: a consumer-grade, swipe-to-donate web app powered by Regen Eliza AI, all on Celo Layer 2 — making it as easy to fund a mangrove project as it is to swipe right.

SwipePad is designed from the ground up as a true consumer app—not just another Web3 tool. With social login, gasless stablecoin donations, we meet users where they are: on their phones, with no wallet required.

We have participated on the last 6 Proof of Shipping programs:

DEMO:

For this Round we are pushing Regen Eliza, because it works in synchronicity together with SwipPad, and with all the community. 

- MiniApps and DApp 

- AI Agent as a Service

NOTE: As we are participating on the Public Good Round and submitting SwipePad miniApps only to that program we do not want to replicate the same effort inhere. That's why we push for the DApp running on the browser, and focusing more in the onboarding more vetted projects, including Partnerships communication person, busines development, community and hosting, DevOps, Technical maintenance, and AI Agent. To not only have a production ready product but, support on the DevOps, communications and partnerships.

### Collaborations

Celo Devs, Mento, Regen Network (tbc), Akiba (tba), ReFi DAO, Regens Unite, GLO Dollar.

### Deliverables

- D1: Production-Ready SwipePad Web DApp on Celo Mainnet A browser-based, mobile-responsive DApp designed for mass adoption, enabling anyone—with or without a crypto wallet—to discover and support climate action through micro-donations.

\-- Users log in via social accounts (Google, X, etc.) using Thirdweb Wallet, instantly receiving a gasless Celo smart wallet 

\-- Supports gasless donations in cUSD, cEUR, and GLO via Celo’s fee delegation 

\-- Displays 50+ vetted, SDG-aligned climate projects, each tagged with location, SDG (e.g., SDG 13), and measurable impact metric 

\-- Integrates Regen Eliza as an AI agent that: 

\_Researches and proposes new high-impact projects 

_\_Generates community content (posts, articles) '_

\_Facilitates outreach to partners and climate collectives 

\-- Includes optional Self Protocol attestation for age and citizenship (privacy-preserving, zero-knowledge) 

\--Accompanied by public product documentation: user flow diagrams, system architecture, and onchain interaction maps 

\*\*Details:

\--Publicly accessible URL live on Celo Mainnet 

\--Video, Demo or GitHub README shows full user journey: social login → swipe → donate → view AI-enhanced impact context 

\-- At least one onchain gasless donation transaction visible on Celo Explorer 

\-- Full source code published on GitHub with clear documentation and open-source license

-  D2: Publish and Implement EAS Schema for “Verified Climate Project” A reusable, public Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) schema that enables any builder to issue trust-minimized attestations for SDG-aligned climate projects.

\-- Schema fields: projectName, sdgTags\[\], location, impactMetric, verifier 

\-- Used in SwipePad to tag all 50+ displayed projects 

\-- Designed for ecosystem-wide adoption across public goods tooling 

\-- Schema deployed and publicly visible at an EAS Scan URL (e.g., https://easscan.org/schema/0x...) 

\-- At least 10 onchain attestations issued for real, vetted projects, visible on EAS Scan

\-- Markdown documentation published in GitHub repo explaining how other teams can use, extend, or verify the schema 

\-- Schema ID shared in at least one public forum (e.g., Telegram, Charmverse, X) with link provided as proof

CIDS Alignment:

\-- UI/UX: Social login + swipe interface removes onboarding friction for non-crypto users 

\-- Interoperability: EAS schema + Celo stablecoins + Karma GAP = composable public goods stack 

\-- Collaboration: Schema is open, documented, and built for reuse by other climate/PG tools 

\-- Product Growth: Transforms internal project vetting into a shared public good, accelerating ecosystem-wide trust

### Budget

Amount Requested: $7,000

Engineering (Web DApp + Thirdweb + Celo + Self) – $3,000 

AI & Hosting (APIs, Tooling and Hosting) – $1,000 

Project Monitoring, Analytics Implementation, Karma GAP Setup – $500 

Project Research & Global South Curation – $1,000 

Business Dev, Comms & Community – $1,000 

Project Management & Tools (Scrum, analytics, reporting) – $500

Risk: AI hallucination in impact summaries → Mitigation: Constrain Regen Eliza to verified data sources + add “unverified” disclaimer. 

Risk: Mobile app store delays → Mitigation: Distribute via TestFlight/Android APK + Celo Wallet deep links.

### GTM & Adoption Plan

Our go-to-market strategy centers on real communities, real campaigns, and real impact—not just code.

We’ll launch a joint “Swipe for Climate” campaign with our core ecosystem friend and community: Regens Unite, ReFi DAO, CPG, Regen Network, Earthbanc, Octant, NounsDAO, Funding the Commons, and Ethic Hub. This includes co-branded content—short videos, impact cards, and user stories—showcasing how a $0.50 swipe can fund verified climate action. All assets will be shared across X (Twitter), Instagram, Farcaster, and community Discord/Telegram channels. We will submit our product to the Reward Stream program on CPG, and work with Celo and CeloDevs to publish and promote the App into their accounts which have a larger audience.

While MiniPay and Farcaster miniApps are being developed under separate proposals, this web DApp will serve as the universal entry point: anyone with a social media account can access it instantly via browser—no app store, no wallet setup. 

We’ll drive traffic through:

\-- Celo Devs & Mento: Promoting SwipePad as a flagship UX for Celo stablecoins (following our 1st-place win in the Stablecoin Hackathon) 

\-- CPG Passport integration: Onboarding 1,000+ Passport holders as early users 

\-- ReFi Starter waitlist: Activating our existing 1,200+ signups with exclusive early access 

We’ll run localized micro-campaigns in Argentina, Venezuela, Egypt, Turkiye, Indonesia, Colombia, Indonesia, and Kenya, partnering with grassroots climate collectives to feature their projects and mobilize local donors. All projects will be SDG-tagged and vetted through open research funded by this grant.

To maximize visibility, we’ll host video sessions to present SwipePad. We will co-organize partnerships and 

Post-December 9, we’ll apply for Ethereum For The World’s Q1 2026 impact rewards and explore DAO-based curation for Regen Eliza—ensuring long-term sustainability through community ownership, not just grants.
