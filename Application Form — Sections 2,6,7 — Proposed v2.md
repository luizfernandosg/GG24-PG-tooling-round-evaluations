## Section 2 — Program Overview and Two-Phase Structure

Regenerant Catalunya’s Localism Fund supports community-led social impact projects with a process- and learning-first approach. The program emphasizes transparent governance (Safe MultiSig), equitable baseline support for all participating projects, and optional deeper experimentation with web3 tools for projects where it is a good fit. The structure below is designed to be clear, accessible, and consistent with the master program decisions.

### Two Phases

- Phase 1 — Onboarding and Documentation (before Christmas)
  - Register your project on KarmaGap and complete basic onboarding.
  - Define objectives and planned activities; document activities as you go.
  - Light-touch verification focused on clarity and participation rather than outcomes.
  - Unlocks the base stipend (see Section 6 for amounts and timing).

- Phase 2 — Optional Advanced Web3 Tools (selection based on applicability)
  - For projects where specific web3 tools meaningfully support their work.
  - Focus on testing tools relevant to the project context; participation is optional.
  - Provides access to additional funding as described in Section 6.

### Participant Commitments

- Maintain timely documentation in KarmaGap (activities, reflections, outcomes/learning).
- Attend the first program workshop and periodic coordination sessions.
- Engage with evaluators when clarifications are needed.
- Follow basic financial documentation requirements for disbursements.

### Governance and Transparency

- Funds are managed via a Safe MultiSig wallet; multiple signatures are required for any transaction.
- Initially stewarded by ReFi Barcelona (Luis Fernando, Andrea, Julio), with subsequent onboarding of Oriol and Mariló as signers to ensure shared governance.
- A 20% operations pool (see Section 6) is managed transparently for evaluator compensation, coordination, and workshops.

## Section 6 — Funding, Budget, and Disbursement

### Program Envelope

- Total program size: €30,000 (local funds plus global matching).
- Matching ratio: 2x on eligible local funds, up to a maximum of €20,000 in global matching.
- Operations pool: 20% of the total program (approximately €6,000) dedicated to evaluator compensation, coordination, and workshops; not exclusive to any single organization.

### Baseline and Additional Funding

- Baseline distribution: a minimum of €1,000 per participating project upon completion of Phase 1 onboarding and verification.
- Additional distribution: available to projects participating in Phase 2 based on applicability of tools, sustained engagement, and quality of documentation (see Section 7). This is not tied to binding performance outcomes and recognizes different contexts and levels of risk.

### Disbursement Mechanics and Timeline

- Treasury: All funds are consolidated and disbursed from a Safe MultiSig wallet with multiple signatories.
- Local fund intake:
  - Miseli contribution: invoiced to Julio’s self-employed account; converted to crypto by Julio (Miseli avoids direct crypto handling).
  - Fundación Kerrasbuchi: B2B process to be coordinated with administration; details confirmed via program communications.
- Critical deadline: Local fund transfers completed before end of month to enable timely matching and program launch.
- Disbursement cadence:
  - Phase 1: base stipend after onboarding, documentation setup, and light verification.
  - Phase 2: additional tranches linked to participation and documented progress.

### Allowable Uses and Documentation

- Funds may support project activities consistent with the program’s social impact scope.
- Documentation in KarmaGap is required for each disbursement.
- All disbursements follow the Safe MultiSig process and require the required approvals.

### Optional Tools Stack (Project-Choice Pilots)

- What it is and how it fits: An optional set of project-chosen Web3 tools piloted in Phase 2 to create portable, verifiable impact credentials and operational capabilities. Participation is guided by mentors and complements the baseline; it informs additional distribution in Phase 2 but is not mandatory.

- Example tools:
  - Silvi (tree planting and stewardship dMRV)
  - Hypercerts / Ecocerts (impact credentials)
  - Gainforest (forest MRV)
  - Sarafu (local currency / commitment pooling)
  - Kokonut Network (syntropic agroforestry design)

- Streaming options under review for Phase-2 releases: Octant V2, Flowstate, Gardens.

- Why this matters: Adopting these tools can improve discoverability and unlock future funding by establishing on-chain histories and credentials; pilots remain right-sized and context-appropriate. Eligibility for additional Phase-2 funding includes timely GAP updates, basic wallet security, and a simple tooling plan agreed with mentors.

## Section 7 — Evaluation and Selection Approach

### Evaluator Council and Remuneration

- Evaluator council: ReFi Barcelona + Oriol + Mariló, with the option to include external experts as needed.
- Evaluator compensation is drawn from the operations pool to recognize time and expertise.

### Evaluation Philosophy

- Qualitative, process- and learning-focused evaluation; outcomes are valuable but not binding conditions for support.
- Special consideration for projects operating in fragile contexts or with higher external risk factors; failure is accepted as part of learning.
- Transparency: decisions and rationales are documented to the extent feasible.

### Criteria and Evidence

- Documentation quality in KarmaGap: clarity, completeness, and cadence of updates.
- Alignment with stated goals and meaningful engagement with the two-phase structure.
- Relevance and potential: whether the approach is plausible and context-appropriate.
- Participation: workshop attendance and responsiveness during coordination.
- Ethics and compliance: adherence to program norms and legal requirements.

Evidence sources include KarmaGap records, workshop attendance, progress updates, and direct communications.

### Funding Implications

- Baseline funding (Section 6) is unlocked after Phase 1 onboarding and verification.
- Additional funds in Phase 2 are guided by the qualitative assessment of documentation quality, engagement, and applicability of the tools being tested. Allocation is not strictly performance/output-based.

### Timing and Process

- Phase 1 verification occurs before Christmas; Phase 2 assessments are rolling as participation unfolds.
- The council may request brief check-ins or clarifications.
- A short, learning-focused final reflection is requested at the end of participation.
